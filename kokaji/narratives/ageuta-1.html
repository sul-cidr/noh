      The text reveals Munechika's inner thoughts. Worried about his ability to
      forge the blade but in deference to the emperor’s envoy, he resolves to
      trust that a miracle will happen.

      The action begins with the wakizure standing at the First Pine and the
      waki kneeling and bowing at the Third Pine. This is followed by the first
      expansion onto the stage-space proper with the two performers walking to

      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 5 and 9</a>,
      respectively.

    The third <em>shōdan</em> of the Waki Enters <em>dan</em> is its high-point.
    It corresponds to a sudden and substantial expansion of the musical texture,
    with the first entrance of the jiutai accompanied the two hand-percussion
    instruments and the nohkan. The <em>shōdan</em> is also characterized by an
    increase in the use of stage-space, with both actors moving from the bridge
    to the main stage. It differs though from the preceding two
    <em>shōdan</em> with its text setting. Up to this point, the text, delivered
    in a spoken fashion, introduced facts, but for the span of this
    <em>ageuta</em>, the focus switches to Munechika’s inner feelings, expressed
    in sung poetry set in <em>hiranori</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of Kokaji’s chants, except two of its three <em>ageuta</em>, are sung
    in the strong

    <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a>

    style. These two <em>ageuta</em>, the first and second ones, carry
    Munechika’s expression of hesitation and self-doubt, and are sung in the
    more lyrical

    <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin" target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a>

    style.
  </p>

  <p>
    Typically, the first line of text of an <em>ageuta</em> is repeated. Here,
    Munechika delivers the first line, and the jiutai repeats it, becoming
    Munechika's voice and sharing his feelings with the audience. As it is
    standard, the initial line and its repetition are separated by an

    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >, joined in this case by the nohkan

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#takane" target="_blank"><em>takane</em></a>

    pattern. That pattern energizes the music and carries the melodic line that
    follows the repetition into the higher range, emphasizing the corresponding
    words. In the case of this <em>ageuta</em>, the high range peaks with the
    words

    <em><time datetime="00:09:26.000" title="00:09:26">shintai</time></em
    >, which could be translated as “must decide,” indicating that Munechika is
    under tremendous pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The entrance of the next nohkan pattern, the

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#naka-no-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >, anticipates a shift in text setting that reflects Munechika's changing
    mindset. The declamatory

    <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a
    >

    used in the first part to express Munechika's self-doubt is replaced with
    the rhythmical

    <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"
      ><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a
    >, a change that could suggest that he has

    <time datetime="00:09:53.000" title="00:09:53"> faith in divine help</time>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>ageuta</em> also corresponds with the first expansion of the use of
    stage space. Up to this point, it had been limited to the Bridge and Square
    1, but as the jiutai carries the chant, both characters walk from the bridge
    to the stage. Closer to the beginning of the <em>shōdan’s</em> second part,
    the envoy kneels at

    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, the
    traditional position for a secondary actor, while Munechika stops
    center-stage at Square 9, turns and kneels to face the audience. By
    occupying the strong central position, which is usually reserved to the
    shite, we can surmise that Munechika’s role is of greater importance than
    most waki's roles.
