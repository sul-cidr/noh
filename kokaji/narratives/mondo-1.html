      The imperial envoy arrives at swordsmith Munechika’s house, where he
      delivers the sovereign's order to forge him a blade. Munechika replies
      that he cannot do this without a skilled assistant, but the envoy tells
      him he must.

      The action takes place on the stage's bridge, which represents the
      entrance to Munechika’s house. The wakizure (imperial envoy), standing at
      the First Pine, calls for Munechika. The curtain rises, and the waki
      (Munechika), dressed in

      <a href="/staging/costumes/#Kokaji-Waki1" target="_blank"
        >"street clothes" of a samurai</a
      >, walks in. He stops at the Third Pine, kneels, and bows to the wakizure.
      They remain in their positions throughout the ensuing dialogue.

    With the introduction of a second actor, the overall dramatic intensity
    increases slightly as the action takes place on the bridge rather than on
    the main stage. The swordsmith Munechika greets the imperial envoy with a

    <time datetime="00:05:41.000" title="00:05:41">customary bow</time>. What
    follows is an unmetered, unaccompanied dialogue in prose that keeps the
    Intermedia Index low.

    After learning that he must forge a sword for the Emperor, Munechika, who is
    doubting his abilities, tries to find a way to decline the request. The
    envoy, getting impatient, delivers his last line: “<em
      >Let me repeat the imperial command</em
    >
    ”, in

    <em><time datetime="00:08:32.000" title="00:08:32">suteru</time></em
    >, a style of forceful singing, stressing his order with a commanding step
    towards the swordsmith.
