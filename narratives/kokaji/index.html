          <p>
            First act: After being visited by an oracle in a dream about a
            powerful sword, the 11th century emperor Ichijō sends an envoy to
            the swordsmith Kokaji Munechika requesting that he forges it.
            Munechika, who does not have an assistant with the proper skills to
            help him create the sword, goes to the Inari shrine to pray. There a
            boy appears and tells him that help is coming.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interlude: A god from a subsidiary shrine appears. He summarizes the
            events that took place in the first half of the play, and concludes
            by surmising that Munechika's prayers will be answered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second act: Munechika returns to his home and prepares for the
            ceremonial forging of the sword. As an answer to his prayers, the
            deity Inari appears in its form as a fox and helps him forge the
            requested sword. After offering it to the envoy, the deity
            disappears.

          <p>
            The

            <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank"><em>Shōdan</em> Map</a>

            under the video represents the play’s intermedia form. It also shows
            that the play is composed of two acts, and that the first one
            contains thirteen shōdan, while the second act has eight.
          </p>

          <p>
            The background color grouping the blocks shows that most

            <em>shōdan</em> are bound into <em>dan</em>. Act I has four

            <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Dialogue, Shite Performs, and Shite
            Exits; Act II also has four: Waki Waits, Shite Re-enters, Shite
            Performs, and Shite Exits. Bringing the cursor over a

            <em>shōdan</em> identifies the <em>dan</em> to which it belongs.
          </p>

          <p>
            A comparison between the duration of the two acts shows that the
            first one is about twice as long as the second, suggesting that the
            setting-up of the plot in the first act is more elaborate than the
            second-act development.
          </p>

          <p>
            The height of the blocks shows the development of the play’s

            <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank">Index of Intermedia</a> (IoI). The
            different heights demonstrate that the development is not linear but
            comes in waves. We have identified three kinds of waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. In the first act, each

            <em>dan’s</em> IoI forms a wave leading to a peak closer to its end,
            suggesting that the relationship between the media complexifies as
            the <em>dan</em> is unfolding. For example, the First act’s Waki
            Enters is composed on five <em>shōdan</em>, whose index increases
            exponentially towards the third one. Then, the IoI peaks during the
            last of the Dialogue's two <em>shōdan</em>. It is during the third
            and last <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite Performs that the IoI peaks,
            while in the Shite Exits it peaks on the second out of three
            <em>shōdan</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second: the rising wave across an act. The way the IoI transforms
            over each act differs substantially. The first act counts four
            waves, whereas there is only one in the second act, as the IoI of
            subsequent <em>dan</em> increases until the instrumental dance in
            the Shite Performs <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual
            setting-up of the plot in the first act, followed by a sustained and
            steady development in the second one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The IoI is at its
            lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its four highest peaks
            create a wave that culminates in the third <em>dan</em>. Because the
            play’s premise is already set, the IoI at the beginning of Act II is
            higher than it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower than Act I
            's highest IoI. However, it does not take long for the IoI to
            recuperate the lost ground and further exceed the first act’s peak,
            when reaching the highest IoI with the instrumental dance.

        <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7">
          Composed of five modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the function of this
          section (<em>dan</em>) is to set up the play’s premise and provide a
          reason for the shite to appear. Although, this role is often assigned
          to the secondary actor, the waki, in Kokaji’s case, this process is
          shared between the wakizure who enters first, and the waki.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7">
          The <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low since four out of
          the five <em>shōdan</em> include unaccompanied prose. The first one
          has an unmetered

          delivered by the wakizure standing on Square 1. The second one has an
          unmetered

          <time datetime="00:05:15.000" title="00:05:15">dialogue</time> uttered
          from the bridge. This is followed by a congruent

          <em>hiranori</em> that marks the first entrance of the jiutai and of
          the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a
          non-congruent nohkan’s part. The two actors enter the main stage as
          the jiutai delivers the chant. If the wakizure was the leader in the

          <em>dan’s</em> first half, the waki takes over in the second half. It
          starts with a very short

          the wakizure kneeling at Square 5, and the waki kneeling at Square 9.
          Finally, the <em>dan</em> closes with a

        <h3>Shite Enters</h3>

        <p>
          There is no Shite Enters <em>dan</em> in Kokaji’s first act. To make
          the appearance of the protagonist mysterious and unanticipated, he is
          not introduced by particular entrance music, rather his entrance is
          merged with the following <em>dan</em> through dialogue with the waki.
        </p>

        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="8,9">Dialogue</h3>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="8,9">
          The function of the Dialogue <em>dan</em> is to set the play’s
          premise. It is spread over two <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with a
          surprising 'call from a distance' by the shite, followed by an
          unmetered and unaccompanied

          <time datetime="00:12:18.000" title="00:12:18">exchange</time> in

          <time datetime="00:14:58.000" title="00:14:58">chant</time> of the
          play. Set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is delivered by the jiutai,
          accompanied by the two-hand percussion instruments in strict rhythmic
          setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part.

        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="10,11,12">Shite Performs</h3>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="10,11,12">
          The first act’s Shite Performs <em>dan</em> establishes the shite's
          character. It is the highlight of Act I, with the play’s first
          dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em>, a <em>kuse-mai</em>. In Kokaji's case,
          it is a sequence of three <em>shōdan</em>, the last of which is the
          <em>kuse</em> proper. The return to non-congruent singing at the
          beginning of the <em>dan</em> lowers the Intermedia Index from the end
          of the preceding one, but then it reaches the highest level in Act I.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="10,11,12">
          The <em>dan</em> starts with a dynamic non-congruent

          <time datetime="00:16:55.000" title="00:16:55">chant</time> sung by
          the jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting
          and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. The next <em>shōdan</em>
          lowers the overall level of congruency even more with

          <time datetime="00:17:56.000" title="00:17:56">
            another non-congruent chant
          </time>

          sung by the shite and jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in
          flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This is
          in clear contrast with the

          <time datetime="00:19:54.000" title="00:19:54">dance-to-text</time>

          <em>shōdan</em> that follows. This is where the kernel of the plot is
          presented and as such it is the first act’s point of focus. The shite
          and jiutai sing the poetic text, set in <em>hiranori</em>, and are
          accompanied by the percussion instruments set in strict rhythm and a
          non-congruent nohkan’s part, which substantially raise the play's
          overall level of congruency.

          The function of the Shite Exits <em>dan’s</em> is to facilitate the
          shite’s exit, while providing a reason for his return in Act II. It
          contains three <em>shōdan</em>. The dramatic and energic second

          <em>shōdan’s</em> that leads to the boy’s exit, but it comes only
          after he has promised to come back to help Munechika forge the
          requested sword.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="13">
          The <em>dan</em> opens with a

          <time datetime="00:29:07.000" title="00:29:07">dialogue</time> in
          prose between the shite and waki whose last line is sung rather than
          spoken. The return to <em>kotoba</em> with the percussion instruments
          in flexible setting, and the absence stage movement, drastically
          reduces the Intermedia index.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="14">
          The next <em>shōdan</em> is the first act's third and final congruent

          <time datetime="00:30:05.000" title="00:30:05">chant</time>. Its
          poetic text, set in <em>hiranori</em>, is performed by the jiutai
          accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic. The addition of a
          short choreography contributes to the Intermedia Index's increase.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="15">
          The first act concludes with an

          <time datetime="00:31:20.000" title="00:31:20">exit music</time>

          accompanying the shite and waki’s exit, as well as the kyōgen’s
          entrance. It is performed by the three percussionists and the nohkan
          player. The rhythmic setting is flexible during the exit of the two
          protagonists, but becomes strict for the entrance of the kyōgen.

          or short performance between the acts, traditionally performed by a
          kyōgen actor, has a dual function. First, it allows time for the shite
          to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character;
          second, it helps clarify the story. The kyōgen is usually unmasked and
          engaged in a discussion with the waki, but in Kokaji the kyōgen is
          masked, since he personifies a deity from a lower-ranked shrine. He
          also addresses the audience since the waki has left the stage for a
          change of costume.

          The function of the Waki Waits <em>dan</em> is to restart the
          narrative and set the scene for the shite’s re-entrance. Kokaji’s Waki
          Waits <em>dan</em> is composed of two <em>shōdan</em>. It opens up
          with a

          set in <em>sashinori</em>, accompanied by a steady percussion beat. It
          is followed by a

          set in <em>ōnori </em>, accompanied by the three percussion
          instruments set in strict rhythm. The jiutai sings it following a
          one-line introduction sang by the waki.

          in strict rhythm, the first one also includes a non-congruent nohkan

          the waki and shite, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments

          Index, and serves as a respite from congruency, so that its return

          the last <em>shōdan</em> is set in

          <em>chūnori</em> with a percussion part in strict rhythm and a
          non-congruent nohkan part.
