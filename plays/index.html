      <h2 id="plays-intro">Why Hashitomi and Kokaji?</h2>
      <p><em>By Tom Hare</em></p>
      <p>
        The modern repertory of noh comprehends more than two hundred plays,
        depending on how one counts them, so what is it that makes these two
        particular plays, <em>Kokaji</em> and <em>Hashitomi</em>, the focus of
        this project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Books and electronic media on noh, in both Japanese and Western
        languages, have generally categorized their content according to the
        five-play system (<em>goban-date</em>) that noh troupes long ago adopted
        in their ordering of formal full-day programs: 1) “god-plays”, 2)
        “warrior-plays”, 3) “wig-plays” (or “third-category plays”), 4)
        “miscellaneous” or “fourth-category-plays” and 5) “demon plays” or
        “finale-plays”. These categories are not very precise. Not all the
        so-called demon plays are actually about demons. Some are about
        lower-ranking gods (maybe “daemon” would be a better way to translate
        the Japanese term) and although the “wig plays” are mostly focused on
        women, with actors in wigs, not all plays focused on women (even wearing
        wigs) are categorized as wig plays (and the main actor often wears a wig
        in other kinds of plays too). “Fourth-category plays are also called
        “miscellaneous plays,” judiciously allowing a catch-all group for plays
        that don’t comfortably fit anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hashitomi</em> is a wig play and <em>Kokaji</em> is generally
        considered a demon play or “fifth-category play, but in some cases it is
        considered a “fourth-category play.” The central figure in
        <em>Kokaji</em> is actually a god (or daemon) rather than a demon
        proper, which may account for its occasional placement in the fourth
        category.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all these inconsistencies, though, the goban-date system has had a
        productive role in structuring occasions of performance, dating back
        into the seventeenth century, if not earlier. But this was still not the
        earliest way of categorizing the repertory of noh, or as it was known
        then, “sarugaku.” In the late fourteenth century, a somewhat different
        typology existed, at least in the writings of Zeami (1363-1443), with
        gods, women, warriors and demons, to be sure, but also the deranged (in
        most cases, women), priests, Chinese “types”, and “roles in which the
        main character doesn’t wear a mask.” Perhaps that was simply the way
        this most prominent noh actor in all the history of noh thought about
        categories of sarugaku performance. But even Zeami wasn’t fully
        committed to such a schema, since he changed to a more abstract system
        of “Three Modes” (Old Man, Warrior, and Woman) in the latter decades of
        his life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of <em>Hashitomi</em> and <em>Kokaji</em> for this site
        doesn’t slot neatly into either of the schemes outlined above, but for
        all that, it provides an instructive perspective on all of them, with
        ties to the historical development of sarugaku into noh as well. Before
        we can compare the plays in this context, though, we should look at them
        individually, to highlight their particular characteristics, both
        typical and unusual. Neither play is mentioned frequently or prominently
        in the historical record of noh, so much of our evidence must come
        internally, from the plays themselves, but that is the best way to
        understand their structure and content anyway.
      </p>
      <h3 id="plays-Hashitomi"><em>Hashitomi</em> (or <em>Hajitomi</em>)</h3>
      <p>
        As is often the case with noh, neither <em>Hashitomi</em> nor
        <em>Kokaji</em> can be confidently attributed to a particular author or
        composer. One of the lists of the noh repertory compiled in the
        seventeenth-century claims that Zeami wrote <em>Hashitomi</em>, but this
        is highly unlikely. The author named in other lists of roughly the same
        time claims the play was written by one Naitō Saemon, or Naitō Tōzaemon,
        or Ninagawa; little is known about these figures apart from similar
        references to the authorship of two other noh plays by the said Naitō,
        so perhaps he was the writer of <em>Hashitomi</em> after all.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> But
        even if we cannot be fully confident in such an identification, the
        question of authorship nonetheless affords us a good perspective on not
        only <em>Hashitomi</em> and its reception but, more broadly, on the
        solidification of performance conventions in noh, inter-arts comparisons
        and what has been termed the “folklore” of The Tale of Genji.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name Naitō Saemon or Tōzaemon itself suggests lineage in a military
        family, and is very different in character from the names of
        professional noh actors we can identify from the fourteenth and
        fifteenth century. It is likely that as a noh or sarugaku playwright,
        Naitō (or whoever composed <em>Hashitomi</em>) was a talented amateur,
        and the play bears various marks of the amateur, not just this name, as
        we shall see. And we should say from the start that “amateur” here is
        not to be taken negatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>Hashitomi</em> bears a number of hallmarks of amateur
        composition, this makes it even more amenable to the identification of
        general characteristics of wig plays, even as it illustrates the
        historical development of noh in the fifteenth century more clearly than
        some of the more celebrated and intricately constructed plays of
        professionals like Zeami.
      </p>
      <p>
        The central character of <em>Hashitomi</em>, for instance, is not
        readily identifiable. She bears certain associations with the famous
        Lady of the Evening Faces, Yūgao no Ue, in The Tale of Genji, but she
        could also be understood to be the spirit of the so-called yūgao plant,
        a type of bottle gourd with a white blossom. Such a spread of
        associations comes about primarily because of the choice of poems and
        other passages from Genji quoted, and sometimes altered, in the play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quotations in question come from a variety of contexts in Genji. One
        is a sophisticated comparison between the moon and a departing lover,
        figuring the lady who longs for him on his departure to the mountain
        horizon. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Another requests that pinks (or dianthus flowers) deign to
        cast a thought, in the form of a dewdrop, onto the stakes of a
        dilapidated fence: this is an elaborate metaphor asking a highborn lord
        to look in upon his little daughter, even though her now dead mother was
        of undistinguished rank. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Both of these allude to important plot
        points early in the narrative of Genji, in connection with the ill-fated
        Lady of the Evening Faces, but both need the context of the tale itself
        to fill out the incidents in question. That, though, does not seem to be
        what the writer of <em>Hashitomi</em> intended. And yet, he was not just
        a magpie, picking up a snatch of poem here and a snatch of poem there.
        He was aiming for a different kind of sophisticated effect, if we are to
        judge from his use of a third poem taken from Genji. This poem appears
        in the play at the most conspicuous place possible, right after the
        shite’s jonomai at the play’s climax. Or, to be more precise, we should
        say that the poem sandwiches the dance, because the first line of it
        (altered in an interesting way) comes before the dance and then, once
        the dance is finished, the full poem is sung. In Genji, too, the poem in
        question comes at a crucial place; there, it serves as the pivot from
        simple curiosity to a fatal romantic encounter. The poem reads:

      <p>
        This episode in Genji is one of its most characteristic, pairing an
        elite teenage male, a player in the erotic competition of the classical
        romance, with a beauty bereft of the political and social connections
        needed to maintain her position, any position, in the society of the
        novel. The initial vector for contact is classical poetry, ostensibly
        about flowers, and these two poems allow the two lovers-to-be to break
        the ice and thus to further the plot of the novel. The hidden female
        speaker of <em>kokoro-ate ni</em> is hinting that she understands it is
        the Shining Prince, Genji himself that passes by her cottage, with its
        <em>yūgao</em> flowers, and Genji, in his response, begs an invitation
        to get a closer look.
      </p>
      <p>
        The poems also draw on a broader cultural matrix, that of an idealized
        classical culture of the royal court. In addition to the figural use of
        the gourd blossom, which links the Lady of the Evening Faces with Genji,
        the cultural associations of the flower, as codified and thematized in
        the practice of court poetry, create a rich world of associations. They
        also set this world in soft focus, by ambiguity and interpretive
        polyvalency. The word <em>tasogare</em>, “dusk”, for instance, provides
        the mise-en-scène for the gourd to blossom — it blooms at nightfall, and
        each blossom perdures for but a single night. This foreshadows the
        brevity of a tragically brief love affair at its very inception. It also
        impresses the time with an emotional character: if <em>tasogare</em> is
        dusk, it is the time when one begins to fail to recognize passers-by.
        Indeed, <em>ta so gare</em> (or <em>kare</em>)” in ancient Japanese
        means “Who is that?”
      </p>
      <p>
        This grounding of the poem is used to specific ends in the novel, but
        when we consider the use of this and other poems from the classical
        tradition in <em>Hashitomi</em>, we find that those are not necessarily
        the same ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is, for instance, a crucial single-syllable change in the way the
        play quotes the Genji verse. Instead of <em>yorite koso</em>, “Only by
        going up close”, the play reads <em>orite koso</em>, which means “only
        by breaking/snapping off”. That could probably be construed to mean
        “take someone captive, romantically (or abusively),” but it is much more
        prominently a word used of gathering sprigs or branches of flowers in
        bloom. This interpretation fits easily into the general aesthetic
        context of <em>Hashitomi</em>, which is occasioned, according to the
        words of the waki in the beginning of the play, by a Buddhist service
        propitiating the flowers that adorn ritual altars (the
        <em>rikka kuyō</em>). With this reference, the play alludes to an
        intellectual debate popular in medieval Japan in which the boundaries of
        sentiency, and thus, of the potential for enlightenment or salvation,
        were disputed. The debate is not fully articulated in the play, but it’s
        clear enough that the composer felt plants and trees were sentient
        beings, and deserving of reverence. In this, he was of the same opinion,
        apparently, as a number of other noh playwrights, including the most
        celebrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this, then, we begin to see <em>Hashitomi</em> in a somewhat
        broader context than merely that of an elegant tableau vivant lifted
        from an old tale. It then reveals links not only to Buddhist thought
        about the natural world, but also to an important inter-arts connection
        with the art of flower arranging.
      </p>
      <p>
        This connection is, in fact, given material expression as the raison
        d’être for a variant performance style for the play, in all five modern
        schools. That variant style, or <em>kogaki</em> specifies a particular
        prop that is not used in more conventional performances. The prop is a
        very large, very formal flower arrangement in an ancient style called
        <em>rikka</em> or “standing flowers”, quoted directly from Buddhist
        antecedents. This arrangement is stationed center-stage for the first
        part of the play when it is performed according to this variant, and it
        adds a beautiful and conspicuous supplement to the already heavily
        floral character of the play.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn’t a clear documentary trail that would tell us when the play
        was first done in this manner, but in that it straddles the worlds of
        noh performance and flower arranging, it points to the aesthetic
        cultivation of a time when amateurs could compose noh plays, and have
        them performed, and integrate them with other overt expressions to their
        cultural capital and inter-arts sophistication. And it is not merely in
        the context of noh and flower arranging that we can see this in
        examining <em>Hashitomi</em>. In addition, we can reconsider the way the
        play deploys the several classical Japanese poems it quotes. If they are
        not used to reimagine a scene from classic literature (as other famous
        noh plays such as Izutsu or Atsumori do), they are nonetheless taken
        from self-conscious and serious aesthetic aspirations. If the poems in
        question don’t all come from a particular narrative context in Genji,
        they nonetheless share a common theme. The poem I mentioned earlier,
        about “the pinks . . . casting a thought, in the form of a dewdrop, onto
        the stakes of a dilapidated fence,” though not from the “Lady of the
        Evening Faces” episode in Genji, nonetheless comes from a foreshadowing
        of that episode in the previous chapter of the tale. It seems very
        likely — and here we would follow Janet Goff in her fine study of noh
        based on Genji — that the composer of <em>Hashitomi</em> might have
        discovered his thematic material for the play in the handbooks created
        for practitioners of linked verse (many of them amateurs), where
        appropriate tags from classical poetry and narrative, were collected and
        arranged topically for the use of latter-age versifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best known of those handbooks, Renju gappekishū, indeed,
        quotes the two poems from the encounter in Genji with the same variant
        first line of the response poem, <em>orite koso</em>, that is cited in
        <em>Hashitomi</em>. <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        One sees a similar propensity to playing a game of poetic allusion in
        some of the Chinese verses quoted in <em>Hashitomi</em>. Those verses
        come mostly from a collection of both Chinese and Japanese verse put
        together in the eleventh century, Wakan rōeishū, and seem less
        successfully integrated into the play than the Genji verses. All the
        same, they point to the same propensity for canvassing a broad
        inter-arts spectrum in order to compose the play.
      </p>
      <p>
        The title <em>Hashitomi</em> (or <em>Hajitomi</em>) has not been the
        exclusive title of this play in such documentation as exists since the
        seventeenth century. It has occasionally been known as Yūgao or Yūgao no
        Ue, provoking some confusion because there is another play of the same
        name in the repertory. Modern scholarly consensus has distinguished the
        two plays, leaving the other with the name Yūgao, pointing as well to
        the latter play’s more consistent and narrative-oriented use of source
        poems from The Tale of Genji. For this reason, the possibility has been
        mooted that that play was created by Zeami or at least by someone
        faithful to the guidelines he articulated.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, though, one can still identify in <em>Hashitomi</em> many of
        those same guidelines: the use of familiar poems from old classics is
        itself something Zeami recommended, and the focus on dance, with the
        fully orthodox
        <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai/"><em>jonomai</em></a>
        of the final act sandwiched between lines from the central poem in the
        play is a common feature of many of the classic plays in the repertory.
        (And although the professional actors and playwrights of the fifteenth
        century cannot be directly credited with the <em>jonomai</em>, they do
        seem to have deployed its ancestor, the <em>tennyo no mai</em> as early
        as the 1420s.)
      </p>
      <p>
        From this perspective, <em>Hashitomi</em> differs considerably from
        <em>Kokaji</em>. Although we have even less information on who composed
        <em>Kokaji</em> than <em>Hashitomi</em>, and although we have no
        documentary evidence to show that it is an old play (of, say, the late
        fourteenth or early fifteenth century). It nonetheless represents an
        older approach to noh, or sarugaku performance, than <em>Hashitomi</em>,
        in that it is a miracle play: the claims of sarugaku tradition hold that
        it originated in the miraculous manifestation of a native deity at the
        foot of a pine tree, the Pine of Divine Revelation (<em>yōgō no matsu</em>) in the ancient capital Nara. Many of the oldest plays in the
        repertory show features of this legend. Some of them are classed as god
        plays according to the <em>goban-date</em> system I mentioned at the
        beginning of this essay. Others, though, often more interesting, are
        plays such as <em>Kokaji</em>, which fall into the final category, the
        so-called “demon” plays. The shite in <em>Kokaji</em>, however, is no
        demon, but rather the god Inari Myōjin, whose avatar is a fox.
      </p>
      <h3 id="plays-&lt;em&gt;Kokaji&lt;/em&gt;"><em>Kokaji</em></h3>
      <p>
        Something that often distinguishes “god plays” from “demon plays” in the
        five-genre system is interest. A few of the god plays are wonderful, but
        many others are rigidly formal and austere (not to say boring). The
        “demon plays” are never boring, and that is in part because of a plot.
        It’s not a complicated multi-layered plot usually, but there is a
        “completion of action” in such a plot: a task is set, as in
        <em>Kokaji</em>, and, despite challenging obstacles, the task is
        accomplished. Often, as in <em>Kokaji</em>, the accomplishment is due at
        least in part to the aid of a god, a very deus-ex-machina.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task in <em>Kokaji</em> is the forging of a sword worthy of royal
        commission. The obstacle is the insistence, on the part of the best
        sword smith in the land, Munechika, that he must have an equally skilled
        partner in order to hammer such a sword into perfection. There is no one
        the Munechika can call upon, so he prays to the god Inari. Then, rather
        abruptly, a mysterious figure (wearing the mask of a beautiful boy)
        calls out to him. In a session that is part coaching and part
        annunciation, the boy encourages Munechika to make preparations to forge
        the sword, doing so with recourse to Japanese proverbs and sententious
        Chinese verse.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a long formal narrative (the <em>kuri-sashi-kuse</em> sequence), the
        boy recounts tales from both China and Japan, of illustrious swords. (No
        pressure!) Then, without more ado, he instructs Munechika to prepare the
        forge, both physically and ritually, only to disappear into the “evening
        clouds of Mt. Inari.” We can already surmise that this story is going to
        have a happy ending, but that doesn’t keep another actor, this time a
        kyōgen actor, from coming on stage as a minor local deity, to rehearse
        the plot once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now to the accomplishment of the task: The plot is resolved in our
        minds, but the excitement of the play is really just getting off the
        ground, for now there is a sequence of musical pieces, some
        instrumental, some with chorus accompanied by the ensemble, during which
        the god Inari manifests himself to his human partner Munechika. This
        appearance of a divine figure echoes the miraculous origins of sarugaku
        itself, but in this case the appearance is only part of the miracle, for
        it takes material form in the sword that Munechika forges with his godly
        partner. Appropriately, the god’s costume will coruscate over metallic
        thread or appliqué, the mask will arrest our attention with a daemonic
        intensity, and to top it all off, we will find a huge red wig crowned
        with a glittering circlet topped, in turn, with a shining image of a
        fox. This is what we came for, the appearance of a god, or a demi-god,
        and the accomplishment of a great task.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sequence of instrumental pieces that mark the last act of the play,
        the <em>raijo</em>, the <em>hayafue</em> and the <em>maibataraki</em>,
        is a tour-de-force, and marks off a special group of plays in the noh
        repertory as of particular excitement. These plays often bring a full
        day’s performance to an end. They are flashy and satisfyingly simple (to
        enjoy, if not to perform). They’ve been a staple of sarugaku performance
        since the late fourteenth-century and have their roots in the oldest
        identifiable traditions of the modern schools of noh.
      </p>
      <div class="conclusion-separator"></div>
      <p>
        With such archaic roots, miracle plays like <em>Kokaji</em> represent a
        kind of Ur-noh. They are discernible in the oldest traditions of the
        Yamato troupes that are the lineal ancestors of modern noh performance,
        and although <em>Kokaji</em> itself may not be that old, it is
        representative of an aesthetic of simple plots with definitive and
        felicitous conclusions. When we look back at <em>Hashitomi</em> from
        such a perspective, we are struck by now different it is, how the
        conclusion is anything but definitive — we don’t really know if the
        central character we’ve been watching for an hour or so is the exquisite
        ghost of the court of Genji or, rather, a transcendent manifestation of
        a gourd blossom. She evaporates as if in a dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her costume will be very beautiful, no doubt, and her mask perhaps
        virtuosically executed, but nonetheless generic. And on top of that,
        unlike <em>Kokaji</em>, with its two masks, <em>Hashitomi</em> requires
        only one. Viewers are likely as not going to be drawn to the fragile
        edifice of a gourd-flower arbor that is the main prop on stage in
        typical performances, as much as they are to the actors themselves. Or
        to an elaborate sculpture of blossoms that is then to be situated center
        stage — with the full acquiescence of the actors — for the entire first
        act of the play, when the play is performed in that special variant
        <em>rikka</em> style. You might say that the visual aesthetic of the
        play is diffused, like the identity of the shite, over the entire stage.
        In this sense, <em>Hashitomi</em> is more a play for expert members of
        the audience, than is <em>Kokaji</em>. As we have seen, it was likely
        composed by an amateur, someone interested not just in noh, but also
        flower arranging, someone eager to show off his knowledge of poems from
        The Tale of Genji, perhaps an aficionado of linked verse with a taste
        for Chinese learning as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these features of <em>Hashitomi</em> make it an excellent resource
        for investigating the value-added aesthetic of plays written to contrast
        with those about gods and demons from the old Yamato tradition. These
        newer plays are more complex thematically and formally more
        self-conscious than those. They were incubated in the aesthetic world of
        the early to mid- fifteenth century, and exhibit an interest in mystery
        and subtlety, often discussed using the term <em>yūgen</em>. Although
        the Yamato tradition of performance lives on in <em>Hashitomi</em> as
        well as in <em>Kokaji</em>, it is transformed by the influence of other
        approaches to performance associated with the area near Lake Biwa,
        closer to Kyoto than the Yamato troupes, as well as by the example of
        mature classic plays such as Izutsu and Matsukaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        That these two plays bear the hallmarks of different aesthetic,
        geographical and ideological strains makes them a particularly
        instructive pair for study.
