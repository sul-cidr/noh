1
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
[WAKIZURE] To begin with,

2
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I am in the service of the Emperor Ichijo.

3
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I am known as Tachibana no Michinari.

4
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It so happens that his Lordship

5
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
has this night had a portentous dream oracle.

6
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The Sanjo swordsmith Munechika

7
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000
must be ordered to forge a blade.

8
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I am on my way now to tell Munechika

9
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of this matter.

10
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[WAKIZURE] Is Munechika at home ?

11
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[WAKI] Who is it that has come here ?

12
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
[WAKIZURE] I am a messenger from the Emperor.

13
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
His Majesty has had a marvelous oracle in a dream.

14
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
According to the oracle, you must forge a fine sword for him.

15
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Please comply with this order at once.

16
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[WAKI] While I certainly must agree to execute this imperial order, 

17
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.000
as I do not have anyone to assist me,

18
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I do not know how I will be able to carry it out.

19
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
[WAKIZURE] What you say sir, seems most strange.

20
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
To hear that someone of your reputation

21
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
does not have an appropriate assistant,

22
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is the most unfortunate news.

23
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[WAKI] Even though I am commanded to do so,

24
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
without an assistant whose skills are equal to my own,

25
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it will not be possible to fulfill this order

26
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to forge an imperial blade.

27
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This is the answer I must give,

28
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
though I am overcome with embarassment.

29
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
[WAKIZURE] Even though it may be as you say,

30
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000
yet as this is the Emperor's wonderful dream oracle,

31
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
it surely must be relied upon

32
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and you must quickly say

33
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you will accept the order.

34
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Let me repeat the imperial command!

35
00:08:42.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[WAKI] At this point, in any case, Munechika

36
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
[JIUTAI] In any case, Munechika

37
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:38.000
must here decide his course of action.

38
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Like the ripples beaten along a well-forged blade, his heart wavers.

39
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yet, as the reign in the present age is righteous,

40
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:20.000
a miracle may well be afforded me.

41
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I must place my trust only in this.

42
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I must place my trust only in this.

43
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
[WAKIZURE] Hurry! make the sword.

44
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
[WAKI] Yes! sir.

45
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.000
[WAKI] This is a great task you have come to give me.

46
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Such a command can be carried out if I ask for divine help.

47
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:56.000
As my family deity is Inari no Myojin,

48
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I will go at once to Inari,

49
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and pray concerning this matter.

50
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[SHITE] Ho there! Is that the Swordsmith of Sanjō, Munechika ?

51
00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
[WAKI] How mysterious! Here is someone who is certainly not an ordinary person.

52
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000
There is no path from the direction from which he has appeared,

53
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and now he has called me by name.

54
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
What manner of man are you ?

55
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[SHITE] You have been ordered

56
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:44.000
by his Imperial Majesty

57
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to forge a sword!

58
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[WAKI] As I thought, you are not what you seem to be,

59
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and events must be of great importance indeed.

60
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I have just received the order to make a blade!

61
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
How could it be that anyone could know so soon ?

62
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
No matter how I consider it, the matter is most strange.

63
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:38.000
[SHITE] In truth, it is as you say. It is said: To know a thing one's self,

64
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.000
it is to find it is known by all.

65
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
[WAKI] A voice in heaven,

66
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[SHITE] echoes on the earth!

67
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
[JIUTAI] Wall have ears:

68
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:19.000
In the world where rocks may speak,

69
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:37.000
In the world where rocks may speak,

70
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and nothing is hidden,

71
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.000
nothing shall dim the radiance

72
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:14.000
of the Emperor's sword.

73
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Only have faith

74
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:31.000
that through his Majesty's grace and the sword

75
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:40.000
will be realized as you wish.

76
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It must be realized.

77
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:09.000
[JIUTAI] Once with such a blade, the Emperor's Three Foot Sword,

78
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:18.000
subdued the rebellion of the Ts'in by its reputation alone.

79
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Again, the Yang Emperor, with his sword Kei 

80
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:54.000
outshone the brillance of the House of Chou.

81
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:11.000
[SHITE] In later years, the Emperor Huan Tsung's Minister Chung K'ei too,

82
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000
[JIUTAI] joined his spirit after death with the virtue of his sword,

83
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and thus served at his Lord's side.

84
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Even evil spirits and demons

85
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
were in fear of that sword's glow,

86
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and the destruction they sought was not achieved.

87
00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[SHITE] Indeed, the virtue of the swords in China and Japan

88
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:35.000
[JIUTAI] and their miraculous power is beyond expression!

89
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[JIUTAI] And so, it was in the early days of our history,

90
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:27.000
the Twelfth of the Imperial Line, the Emperor Keikō,

91
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:38.000
had a son known by the name

92
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Yamato-dake.

93
00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:10.000
The wild barbarians! he received the order to subdue them.

94
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:23.000
The barrier check points far behind as yet further to the East.

95
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:36.000
The road of his journey to the Eastern provinces took him.

96
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Even at Ise and Owari the waves on the sea rise and return!

97
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000
With envy he wondered always, 

98
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:13.000
when he too might find himslef, with foam-drenched sleeves

99
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:34.000
returning home, even as he continued on his way.

100
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:52.000
[SHITE] In the battles in one place and in the next 

101
00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:03.000
[JIUTAI] Men and horses: their bodies crushed in their caverns,

102
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:15.000
their blood on the battlefields a river,

103
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:28.000
their shields swept away on crimson waves again and again.

104
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Finally the barbarians removed their helmets,

105
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:47.000
lay down their arms and were made to surrender.

106
00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:10.000
From the time of this Prince's reign, the royal sport of hunting was begun.

107
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
It was an incident that occurred, 

108
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.000
on the twentieth day of the Tenth month:

109
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Everywhere the autumn tints had faded,

110
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:58.000
and even on the distant winter withered mountains,

111
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:10.000
the traces of the first snow fall could be seen.

112
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[SHITE] The barbarians surrounding him on every side

113
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:34.000
[JIUTAI] Set fire to the grass of the withered fields, and as the blaze burned high

114
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:44.000
and as the blaze burned high with heavy lingering billows of smoke.

115
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Began to beat their war drums in the signal to attack.

116
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:12.000
The Towering flames! as the attack blazed forward

117
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
[SHITE] The Prince drew his sword

118
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
[JIUTAI] The Prince drawing his sword,

119
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.000
wielded it about him.

120
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
At once, the flames drew back,

121
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:54.000
as it mowed down the grasses in all directions.

122
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:04.000
The spirit of the sword became a storm

123
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:11.000
blasting back the raging flames and grasses too.

124
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
The blaze lit up the heavens, covered the earth!

125
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000
A furnace of fierce flames turned back to devour the enemy forces.

126
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Thus, the countless barbarians,

127
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:36.000
and cavalrymen were brought down.

128
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.000
So in later years the Empire was at peace:

129
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.000
So much so that the people forgot to bar the doors of their houses.

130
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000
This is because of the 'Grass-cutter', it was said.

131
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And now, this auspicious omened blade

132
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
that you must forge!

133
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Is there any reason it should be a lesser blade than that ?

134
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Munechika, heir to a house of proud tradition,

135
00:28:43.000 --> 00:29:06.000
set your heart at rest and go home now.

136
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:16.000
[WAKI] What you have told me of the power of the swords in China and Japan

137
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:25.000
has gladdened my heart at this important hour.

138
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yet, I press you again to tell me who you are ?

139
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[SHITE] Who I may be is of no consequence, but you must pray!

140
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Before anything else adorn your forge mound

141
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000
where you will temper the Imperial blade.

142
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And at that time, if you will but wait for me.

143
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[JIUTAI] I will change into supernatural form.

144
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Having changed into a supernatural form,

145
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
I will come without fail, at the appointed time,

146
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:43.000
and join you, adding my strength to yours.

147
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Then wait for me!

148
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
So saying, into the evening clouds of Mt. Inari

149
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
without a sign of where he went, he vanished,

150
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Without a sign of where he went, he vanished.

151
00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:01.000
[KYŌGEN] I am the god of a subsidiary shrine 

152
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:10.000
and in the service of Inari-daimyōjin.

153
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:19.000
I have come here before you now on a matter of no small importance.

154
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Now then, it seems that the Emperor Ichijo, sixty-sixth of the imperial line,

155
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:39.000
has recently had a portentous dream oracle.

156
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:47.000
According to it, the Sanjo swordsmith Munechika,

157
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
must be ordered to forge a blade.

158
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:04.000
At that time Minister Michinari was the imperial envoy

159
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000
who gave him the details of the imperial message.

160
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Munechika hearing the message, agreed to comply with the order,

161
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:27.000
though to forge such an important blade,

162
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:36.000
he said, was something he could not do by himself

163
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:46.000
"As it will be impossible without an assistant of skill equal to my own,

164
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I should certainly refuse this order, but as this is a request from the Emperor himself,

165
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I know it would bring great shame to my house to decline and so I will accept it," he said.

166
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:22.000
And so, as it would not be possible for him to forge the sword by himslef on this occasion,

167
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.000
in order to do it he decided he must call on divine power,

168
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
in other words, on Inari Daimyojin, his family's tutelary god.

169
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:47.000
If indeed a deity could watch over his forge,

170
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.000
he decided he must go at once and pray concerning the matter.

171
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
As he did this so humbly, the god of the Inari shrine knew of it and, 

172
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:16.000
taking the form of a youth, appeared and met 

173
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:28.000
with Munechika, and spoke to him.

174
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Commonly, in our land there have been,

175
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
from the Age of the Gods, two sacred swords.

176
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
The one called "Totsuka no Tsurugi", the Ten-span Sword

177
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:59.000
was used by Susanō-no-mikoto, when learning of the great serpent

178
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:10.000
at the headwaters of the Hi River in the country of Izumo,

179
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:20.000
he destroyed it, due to the virtue of this sword.

180
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Then again, the sword called "Murakumo no Tsurugi" the Gathering Clouds Sword,

181
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:38.000
was the sword he found at that time in the tail of the great serpent.

182
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Then again, Yamatodake-no-mikoto the second son of Emperor Keikō,

183
00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000
the twelfth of the imperial line, subdued the people of the eastern lands,

184
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
this also due to the virtue of that sword.

185
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:19.000
From that time, it was renamed and known as 'Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi" the Grass Cutting Sword.

186
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:28.000
In addition to these, there are the Han Emperor's Three Foot Sword,

187
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:40.000
the Gan JIang and Mo Ye swords. He told him many stories

188
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:50.000
of the virtue of swords, both in China and in our own country.

189
00:40:50.000 --> 00:41:01.000
"You, too, if you are a swordsmith of repute, will be able to forge a blade of equal merit.

190
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Prepare, temper the metal, and wait."

191
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000
At that time, Myojin will appear and be your assistant

192
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
in forging the blade. This being the case,

193
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Munechika, his eyebrows relaxed in joy,

194
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:45.000
is even now coming this way to do these things.

195
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000
In this way then, whe prayers are offered

196
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
they shall be fulfilled, without a doubt.

197
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.000
On this matter, rest assured,

198
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000
rest assured.

199
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
[WAKI] Now, I, Munichika, in compliance with the Imperial Will

200
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000
have accordingly ascended the dais to ward off impurities.

201
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.000
It is adorned with the Seven-fold Sacred Rope,

202
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:30.000
and in the four corners sacred images place in reverence.

203
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:47.000
I raise up this Sacred wand and make my petition.

204
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Now, in the reign of the Sixty-sixth Emperor Ichijo,

205
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I have been honored greatly in my craft,

206
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.000
through no effort of my own, 

207
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:19.000
rather, I have held in trust those skills.

208
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:28.000
When Izanagi and Izanami crossed over

209
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.000
the Floating Bridge of Heaven,

210
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:45.000
and probed the Abundant Reed Plain

211
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:52.000
with the Sacred Spear was their beginning.

212
00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Later, from holy Hashimida of Eastern India

213
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000
the descendants of Amakuni and Fujito

214
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:21.000
learned arts

215
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.000
which I am now the master of.

216
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:43.000
[WAKI] Now, I pray!

217
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:53.000
[JIUTAI] Now I petition: It is not for the glory of my name: Munechika, 

218
00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:11.000
but at the imperial command of the Emperor,

219
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:27.000
whose rule extends from heaven to earth, that I call on all divine beings, 

220
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:42.000
numberless as the sand of the Ganges,

221
00:49:42.000 --> 00:50:04.000
to join your strength now with Munechika.

222
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:12.000
I offer up this sacred wand.

223
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:34.000
I bow my head before heaven as I seek divine aid from my inmost being.

224
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Hear and grant my prayer

225
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.000
[WAKI] With profound reverence:

226
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:12.000
[JIUTAI] My supplication!

227
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:46.000
[JIUTAI] Now, Munechika -- the Imperial Blade!

228
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Now, Munechika -- the Imperial Blade!

229
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:10.000
The appointed time for forging is known!

230
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Trust and have faith!  Only trust!

231
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:33.000
[SHITE] A young boy ascends the forge mound!

232
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:46.000
[JIUTAI] A young boy ascends the forge mound,

233
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:55.000
kneels and bows three times before Munechika.

234
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:04.000
"Now then, the metal for the blade?" he says

235
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:13.000
and Munechika, his heart joyful, in reply

236
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
brings for the metal.

237
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:28.000
As he strikes the first blow with his mallet,

238
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:38.000
[SHITE] Clang! we strike!

239
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
[JIUTAI] Clang!

240
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
[SHITE] Clang, again.

241
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:55.000
[JIUTAI] The blows coming, one on another, the sound of their mallets

242
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:10.000
echoes throughout heaven and earth - How it resounds!

243
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000
[WAKI] And so the Imperial Blade is forged:

244
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
On the face of it I strike: "Munechika, Swordsmith"!

245
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:29.000
[SHITE] As your timely apprentice the god:

246
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:39.000
"Little Fox", I skillfully strike on the reverse.

247
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:50.000
[JIUTAI] Along the edge of the blade are beaten traces

248
00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:00.000
like wild clustering clouds.

249
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:12.000
"Clustering Clouds of Heaven", it will be!

250
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:23.000
[SHITE] First under Heaven:

251
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.000
[JIUTAI] First under Heaven:

252
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:36.000
The sword with two inscriptions!

253
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:43.000
It will rule the land to the four seas,

254
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
celebrate the abundance of the five staple crops.

255
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.000
"I, before you, as the deity of your clan:

256
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:02.000
the manifestation of Inari: the Little Fox,

257
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000
come to aid you in fulfilling your task.

258
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Now, I am done!" So saying, takes his leave.

259
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Once more he leaps upon the mass of clouds,

260
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Again, more he leaps upon the mass of clouds,

261
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:52.000
and return to Higashiyama, the eastern mountains, the peak of Mt. Inari!
