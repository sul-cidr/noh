1
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000
[WAKI] I am a priest living at Urin-in in Murasakino,

2
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in the Northern hills of the capital.

3
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I have offered flowers throughout the summer.

4
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000
As my period of retreat is coming to a close,

5
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I will gather fine blossoms

6
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and perform a memorial service for the flowers.

7
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:25.000
[WAKI] With reverence, I proclaim this memorial service for flowers.

8
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Though they are said to be insentient plants,

9
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:45.000
these flowers blossom in wide woodlands.

10
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:59.000
How could they be said to be without feelings?

11
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Especially the lotus appearing from the mud

12
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and that has become the title of the one sublime law.

13
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Drawn by this time even plants, trees,

14
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:52.000
all the earth, achieve Buddhahood.

15
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:17.000
[SHITE] As when the hand takes them,

16
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the hand itself sullies them.

17
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:50.000
To the Buddhas of the Three Realms

18
00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I offer them as they are.

19
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
[WAKI] How strange! Until now

20
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I saw them only as flowers grasses, yet among them

21
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I see a single white flower whose brows seem

22
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
to unfold in a smile

23
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:43.000
What manner of flower are you offering ?

24
00:14:43.000 --> 00:15:00.000
[SHITE] A foolish question, holy priest.

25
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Though in this twilight hour you see it,

26
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:34.000
You do not recognize this flower!

27
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Its name seeming human, on lowly hedges it hangs,

28
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that you do not know its name is reasonable.

29
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:34.000
This is the 'evening face' flower.

30
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[WAKI] Indeed, it is an "evening face"!

31
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Who is it that has offered this flower?

32
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:12.000
[SHITE] Without giving my name you will know it in the end.

33
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I have come from this flower's shadow.

34
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:41.000
[WAKI] So then, are you no longer in the world

35
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and came to attend this memorial service for flowers?

36
00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:04.000
But please, you must tell me your name.

37
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:14.000
[SHITE] I have a name, though I am no longer alive,

38
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:24.000
part of an old story.

39
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:33.000
[WAKI] At a certain mansion,

40
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:52.000
[SHITE] I could always be found, indeed it is so.

41
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:15.000
[JIUTAI] Near Gojō, she said, of the "evening face."

42
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Near Gojō, she said, of the "evening face."

43
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:56.000
In the moment the eyes turn aside, she becomes a dream.

44
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Only her image lingers behind

45
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:34.000
as she disapperas in the shadow of the flowers.

46
00:20:34.000 --> 00:21:02.000
She disappears in the shadow of the flowers.

47
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
[KYŌGEN] I am someone who lives

48
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:35.000
in the Kitayama area of the capital.

49
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I have heard that near here, 

50
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:52.000
at Unrin-in, there will be memorial services

51
00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
for the lowers offered over the summer.

52
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:18.000
This being the case, I too, intend to go there.

53
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Truly, as few people are going there this evening,

54
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000
it is rather melancholy.

55
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:53.000
[WAKI ]Ho, there! Are you someone from around here ?

56
00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[KYŌGEN]  Indeed, I am a person from this area.

57
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:13.000
[WAKI] If that's the case, first of all, could you come closer ?

58
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
There is something I would like to ask you.

59
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[KYŌGEN] Certainly.

60
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Well then, what is the matter

61
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:53.000
you would like to ask me about ?

62
00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[WAKI] While it isn't a circumstance of much importance,

63
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I would like you to tell me the particulars of the story of Lady Yūgao,

64
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
of the Evening Faces, who lived here long ago.

65
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:37.000
[KYŌGEN] This is an unexpected request you've made of me.

66
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I don't know about the situation in much detail, but 

67
00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I will do the best I can to tell you the story as I have heard it.

68
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Well then, the one known as Lady Yūgao was the daughter

69
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
of a middle captain of the third rank, and,

70
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
owing the certain circumstances, 

71
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:53.000
she came to live in seclusion in the area of Gojo. 

72
00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Also at the at time, Hikaru Genji

73
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:14.000
was paying regular visit to the home of Lady Rokujo.

74
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:24.000
On occasion he would pass through the Gojo area

75
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000
and it happened that there was a simple dwelling there

76
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:40.000
with "evening faces" blooming in splendid profusion.

77
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
He called Koremitsu to him, 

78
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:54.000
and requested that he go pluck a blossom.

79
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:10.000
When Koremitsu spoke to his attendant,

80
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
a child came out of the house, and,

81
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:25.000
having asked that he wait there for a wile, soon after,

82
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:37.000
offered him a white fan, its edges perfumed with incense,

83
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000
on which rested a blossom of the "evening faces".

84
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:58.000
The attendant took this and returned with it to Koremitsu.

85
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Koremistu went with it to Genji, who, 

86
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:21.000
seeing then that there was a poem on the edge of the fan,

87
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
quickly wrote a verse in reply.

88
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Because of that flower, he was drawn to the Lady Yūgao,

89
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:46.000
of the evening faces, and as the vows they shared were not shallow,

90
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:55.000
after that he came to stay together with her there at her dwelling.

91
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Even as the purity of the many pledges

92
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
they exchanged were profound-

93
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:18.000
By the Sacred Treaures! Mysteroiusly,

94
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Lady Yūgao was possessed

95
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.000
by some sort of vengeful spirit, and it is said that all was lost... 

96
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:46.000
As to Hikaru Genji's grief, its depth was limitless

97
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:59.000
as there was nothing to be done for her, it is said.

98
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:07.000
In any event, those are the details,

99
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:16.000
at least in broad terms, as I know them.

100
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000
But why are you interested in this 

101
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:33.000
and asking me about this matter now ? I find it suspicious.

102
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[WAKI] I'm grateful that you have described the matter so thoroughly.

103
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:52.000
When I was performing a memorial service for flowers

104
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
offered during the summer, a woman appeared

105
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:11.000
and gave me a white flower.

106
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
I asked who, and what sort of person, she was with the flower,

107
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:25.000
to which she replied speaking of the Lady of the Evening Faces

108
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:38.000
as though she spoke of herself.

109
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Then she disappeared in the shadow of the flowers.

110
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
That's what happened.

111
00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:01.000
[KYŌGEN] How astonishing!

112
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
What a wondrous thing you have related to me.

113
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Now then, if I may say what I suppose, it can only be that

114
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:23.000
when you were performing the memorial service for flowers,

115
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:37.000
the spirit of the "yugao flower", and also the ghost of Lady Yūgao,

116
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Lady of the Evening Faces, of long ago appeared before you.

117
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:59.000
This being the case, I believe that due to 

118
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
the merit emanating from your Reverence,

119
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
the spirit of the Lady Yūgao appeared to you in order

120
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.000
to ask that you offer prayers for her deliverance.

121
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:35.000
If that is the case, you should go now to the Gojo area,

122
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:43.000
where a miracle will surely occur. Then you should pray earnestly

123
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:57.000
for her enlightenment as she has requested of you.

124
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[WAKI] As I also believe this to be true,

125
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
I will go to the Gojo area and pray there

126
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:25.000
For the ghost of the Lady Yūgao and her deliverance.

127
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:38.000
[KYŌGEN] As you will be going there shortly,

128
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:49.000
I'll follow after your Recerence in a while.

129
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
[WAKI] In due time then, I will expect you there.

130
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[KYŌGEN] I'll do as you say.

131
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:32.000
[WAKI] Following what I was told earlier

132
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:43.000
I have to go to Gojo to see:

133
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Indeed, the mansion, as in the past,

134
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:09.000
the dwelling and its evening faces.

135
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Gourds now often empty,

136
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:43.000
and (Genken's) Yen Yūan's home overgrown with weeds.

137
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:49.000
[SHITE] Densely closed off by goosefoot,

138
00:42:49.000 --> 00:43:10.000
the evening sun creates mountain shadows,

139
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:35.000
comes through the window and then leaves.

140
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:57.000
[JIUTAI] The faint sound of a hidden spring.

141
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Rain dampens Genken's (Yüan Hsien) gate.

142
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:58.000
[SHITE] But what dampens the sleeves is

143
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:27.000
dawn on the snow on Mount Lu.

144
00:45:40.000 --> 00:46:04.000
[JIUTAI] Through the east window the limpid moon,

145
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Through the east window the limpid moon,

146
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:47.000
on the zither stand casts its light.

147
00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains.

148
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Such a desolate evening!

149
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:27.000
[JIUTAI] Indeed, the desolate sound of the wind,

150
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:38.000
the wicker bamboo fence as in the past.

151
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Please show me your form in a dream

152
00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:07.000
I will pray in earnest for your soul.

153
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:30.000
[SHITE] The moon, uncertain of the mountain ridge as it went

154
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:48.000
and disappeared in the sky high above without a trace.

155
00:48:48.000 --> 00:49:03.000
When will they meet again ?

156
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:23.000
[JIUTAI] Though the mountain dweller's fence has fallen into ruin, from time to time

157
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:38.000
[SHITE] Show compassion for the wild pink

158
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:51.000
[JIUTAI] Blossom, if I reaveal the form

159
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000
[SHITE] Will you pray for my soul ?

160
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
[JIUTAI] Certainly, I will.

161
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:33.000
[SHITE] Thinking, "well then,"  the "evening face"

162
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:58.000
[JIUTAI] The vine-covered lattice shutter pushes open,

163
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:13.000
revealing her form as she steps out.

164
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:43.000
At the sight tears flow without stopping.

165
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:19.000
[JIUTAI] At that time, Genji

166
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:31.000
the Middle Captain as he was called,

167
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:45.000
shared the grass pillow of this "evenig face" for a brief rest.

168
00:52:45.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Through the night they heard from next door

169
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:18.000
a pilgrim's voice in prayer 

170
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:39.000
about ascending the sacred peak at Miyoshino.

171
00:53:39.000 --> 00:54:30.000
"Save us, holy guide of the way in the future, Maitreya Buddha!", he chanted.

172
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Even now this service has brought back the memory

173
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:33.000
of that time and unmittingly tears dampen my sleeves.

174
00:55:46.000 --> 00:56:05.000
But more than that, I cannot forget the evening

175
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:30.000
when Genji first saw this house.

176
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Beckoning to Koremitsu,

177
00:56:40.000 --> 00:57:00.000
"Pick that flower for me," he ordered.

178
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:22.000
On a white fan, its edges perfumed with incense,

179
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:46.000
the flower was picked and presented.

180
00:57:46.000 --> 00:58:10.000
[SHITE] Genji, gazing at it intently,

181
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:32.000
[JIUTAI] "Of you passing in the distance..." he asked

182
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:52.000
and if I had not answered about the flower

183
00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:30.000
forever we must have remained strangers. We were brought together 

184
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:49.000
by the fan touched by our hands, in a joyous pledge of love.

185
00:59:49.000 --> 01:00:05.000
If from time to time

186
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:19.000
 I visit this dwelling of a homeless fishergirl

187
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:42.000
not knowing the owner's name, I hope 

188
01:00:42.000 --> 01:01:01.000
to be as white foam finding at last the shore, he thought, 

189
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and composed a poem.

190
01:01:36.000 --> 01:02:24.000
[JIUTAI] If you pick it

191
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:40.000
[SHITE] If you pick it

192
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:52.000
then, indeed you will know it

193
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:15.000
in the twilight

194
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:36.000
[JIUTAI] Faintly visible:

195
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:48.000
The flowering "evening face",

196
01:18:48.000 --> 01:19:00.000
the flowering "evening face",

197
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:29.000
the flowering "evening face".

198
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:57.000
[SHITE] "As my final home I have shown you

199
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:14.000
[JIUTAI] Always pray for me

200
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:28.000
[SHITE] I beg you", she said, and

201
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:44.000
[JIUTAI] as she spoke the crowing of the cocks,

202
01:20:44.000 --> 01:21:00.000
[SHITE] The tolling of the bells too,

203
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:14.000
announce the coming of dawn.

204
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:29.000
[JIUTAI] As nothing will be hidden in the morning light,

205
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:56.000
"Before dawn breaks, to the dwelling of the "evening face",

206
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:24.000
"before dawn breaks, to the dwelling of the "evening face",

207
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:57.000
she says, and again goes within the lattice shutter,

208
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:49.000
just so, becoming one with the dream.
