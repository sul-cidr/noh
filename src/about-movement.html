          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Despite its apparent minimalism, the movement in Noh is vital,
            sophisticated and performed with great precision. It serves
            structural, aesthetic, and narrative functions. It co-creates
            <a href="/about-intermedia/#Kurai" target=" _blank"
              ><em>kurai</em></a
            >, the overarching expressive quality of the play.
          </p>

          <p>
            Its structure guides viewers through the play's form. For example,
            one can expect a play to start with the waki entering and walking to
            Square 1 for his introduction, before eventually moving to his
            standard resting position at Square 5. Or, during the instrumental
            dance, the viewers can follow the cues provided by the actor, who
            signals the opening of the dance's sections with its fan, which is
            first closed, then open, and then maybe reversed, before being
            closed again to announce the imminent end of the dance. Such large
            scale organization of stage movement helps create a familiar frame.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the smaller scale of time, Noh involves abstract movement
            patterns that are equally familiar to the viewers. Using them in
            different roles allows actors to add unique aesthetic beauty and
            depth to the characters by imbuing the movement with subtle
            expressive qualities. The abstract nature of the patterns in the
            instrumental dance in particular allows for evocation and profound
            contemplation.
          </p>

          <p>
            When movement is done in direct reference to the narrative it is
            often very sparse. It uses mimetic gestures that symbolize rather
            than literally depict. As such, it calls on the imagination of the
            viewer and deepens their engagement with the play, its narrative,
            and the protagonist.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Kata">Kata</h3>
          <p>
            The movements of actors in Noh are choreographed using an extensive
            vocabulary of basic patterns called <em>kata</em>. The patterns can
            be classified into two categories: formal and mimetic. The way they
            are sequenced creates more extended motions and dances. Our
            classification and English translation of <em>kata</em> names are
            based on the work of Monica Bethe and Karen Brazell. (<em
              >Dance in the Noh Theater</em
            >, Volumes 1, 2, and 3 published by Cornell University under the
            Cornell East Asia Series, number 29.) The core elements of all Noh
            movement are the basic posture (<a
              href="/movement/standing/"
              target="_blank"
              ><em>kamae</em></a
            >) that serves as the start and end of all movement and a sliding
            walk (<a href="/movement/forward/" target="_blank"
              ><em>hakobi</em></a
            >) that provides the essential flow.
          </p>

          <h4 id="Formal">Formal kata</h4>
          <p>
            Ubiquitous and essential, they can appear at any time and anywhere
            on the stage. Some are performed only at specific times and places,
            creating structure. They can involve coordination between feet and
            arms. Some have variants performed with a fan either open or closed.
            They recur throughout the play but especially early on and during
            instrumental dances (<em>mai</em>).
          </p>

          <h4 id="Mimetic">Mimetic kata</h4>
          <p>
            They add depth to the narrative rather than establish structure.
            Commonly used to illustrate meaning of sung text, they are often
            focused on one body part with a unique stipulation, such as, with a
            closed or open fan. They become more frequent as the play progresses
            and are normally found in such narrative <em>shōdan</em> like the
            <em>Kuse</em> and <em>Kiri</em>.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Modes">Modes of Movement</h3>
          <p>
            In his theoretical works, Zeami (c.1363 - c.1443) has defined three
            basic modes of movement:<br />
            Aged Mode (<em>rōtai</em>): embodiment of tradition and the
            divine.<br />
            Feminine Mode (<em>nyotai</em>): suggesting sensitivity to beauty
            and emotion.<br />
            Martial Mode (<em>guntai</em>): representing supernatural, demonic
            quality as well as assertive masculinity.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the modes are not strictly associated with gender or even
            specific characters. For instance, in one play a deceased soldier
            dances in the feminine mode over melodic and lyrical chanting, but
            switches to the martial mode when depicting the battle that led to
            his death.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most generally <em>kata</em> performed in feminine mode are
            characterized by a closed position of the feet, round gesture,
            slower tempo and a fluid rhythm, whereas <em>kata</em> performed in
            martial mode have the actor's feet positioned further apart, using a
            more angular motion, and faster tempo. For the sake of comparison,
            several <em>kata</em> included in the Catalog of Kata are presented
            both in feminine and martial modes.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Dances">Dances</h3>
          <p>
            All movement in Noh is highly formalized and bears a resemblance to
            dance. In Noh tradition though, there is a special term for dance,
            <em>mai</em>. It refers to the instrumental dance that typically
            appears in the second half of the play, when the movement of the
            shite is formal and the accompaniment is purely instrumental. These
            are considered the highlights of the plays. In some plays, all of
            the performance until then may be seen as the preparation for this
            special expressive climax when words cease and the audience gets to
            contemplate the protagonist's nature, essential emotion, or state of
            mind, expressed through dance and music only.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two kinds of <em>mai</em>: <em>mai</em> proper and
            <em>hataraki</em>. Both share a basic structure. The actor typically
            starts upstage, moves forward, then to the stage-right corner, and
            after circling once or more, returns to where he started. Depending
            on the character of the protagonist this movement can be slow or
            fast, the gestures can be more sharp or fluid, and the relationship
            to the beat strict or flexible. The difference between the two is
            that <em>mai</em> is longer in duration and has a larger number of
            subsections than <em>hataraki</em>. <em>Mai</em> is normally more of
            a stand-alone scene, while <em>hataraki</em>, provides a glimpse of
            the moment's mood, emotion, or dramatic action, it often depicts
            scenes of exorcisms or fight. <em>Jonomai</em> from Hashitomi is an
            example of <em>mai</em>, while <em>maibataraki</em>, represents a
            <em>hataraki</em>
          </p>

          <h3 id="Shimai">Shimai and Maibayashi</h3>
          <p>
            Besides dance in the context of a Noh play, there are two other
            forms of dance. Dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em>, such as
            <em>Kuse</em> and <em>Kiri</em>, can be performed as stand-alone
            dances. This form of dance, called <em>shimai</em>, includes a
            jiutai usually composed of four members, but no
            <em>hayashi</em>.<br />
            Instrumental dances can also be performed as stand-alone dances.
            This form of dance called <em>maibayashi</em> includes a
            <em>hayashi</em> and a jiutai with a membership that can vary
            between three and eight singers.
          </p>

          <p>
            When performing a <em>shimai</em> or <em>maibayashi</em>, the actor
            is not masked and wears a crest-adorned <em>kimono</em> and
            <em>hakama</em> rather than a costume. Also, the fan is larger than
            the one used in a play, and it is handled differently by the members
            of the jiutai. They kneel with hands in their pockets, fans resting
            on the stage floor when inactive, and hold the fan upwards when
            singing in a play, or resting on their laps when singing in a
            <em>shimai</em> or <em>maibayashi</em>.
