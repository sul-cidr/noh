    <p>
      A high-pitched melodious and short
      <a href="/music/voices#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant
      sung by the shite, the jiutai, or both. Kokaji’s <em>Kuri</em> is set for
      jiutai accompanied by ōtsuzumi, kotsuzumi and nohkan.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Kuri's</em> text is based on a sequence of 7 + 5 syllables but is
      classified as an
      <a href="/text/#Arhythmic" target="_blank">arhythmic</a> text. This is
      because one must be able to hear the subdivision of a text into two
      hemistiches for it to be considered a rhythmic text. The overall complex
      rhythmic organization of the <em>Kuri</em> makes it impossible to hear
      that the text is organized into two groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Kuri</em> is one of the Introduction chants, although its introductory
      nature is rather ambiguous. <em>Kuri's</em> narrative introduces the story
      presented in the next <em>shōdan</em>, the
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/sashi" target="_blank"><em>Sashi</em></a
      >, whose narrative is then fully developed in the next <em>shōdan</em>,
      the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/kuse" target="_blank"><em>Kuse</em></a
      >. Because the <em>Kuri</em> leads to the <em>Kuse</em>, it is classified
      as an 'Introduction' chant.
    </p>

    <p>
      When sung by an actor, the <em>Kuri</em> often follows a
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/shidai-chant" target="_blank"
        ><em>Shidai</em>-chant</a
      >
      or
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/issei-chant" target="_blank"
        ><em>Issei</em>-chant</a
      >. On the other hand, it precedes a <em>Sashi</em> when sung by the
      jiutai, as it is the case in Kokaji. It always concludes with its
      signature melisma called <em>hon-yuri</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nohkan performs two patterns during the <em>Kuri</em>. The first one,
      also called <em>kuri</em>, is short. The longer pattern, called
      <em>yuri</em>, follows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kokaji's <em>Kuri</em> is sung in
      <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a>
      style. For the most part, its melody is sung on the Medium/High tone.
      However, the module's name refers to the high pitch <em>kuri</em>; thus,
      the melody of Kokaji's <em>Kuri</em> includes four melodic motions towards
      the <em>kuri</em> tone. They appear as part of embellishments, and are
      highlighted in bold in the video's text. Finally, the signature closing
      melisma <em>hon-yuri</em> closes the chant on the Low tone.
