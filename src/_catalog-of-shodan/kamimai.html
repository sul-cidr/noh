      As its name signifies, <em>Kamimai</em> (meaning 'god dance') belongs to
      the category of <em>mai</em>, similar to the <em>jonomai</em> which
      appears in <em>Hashitomi</em>. It is an instrumental dance exclusively
      used for plays in the first category, featuring a god as the main dancer.
      The <em>Kamimai</em> is known as the fastest of all the instrumental
      dances in Noh. Unlike other dances, such as <em>jonomai</em>, the
      <em>Kamimai</em> does not include significant tempo changes during
      transitions from part to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all instrumental dances, the <em>Kamimai</em> consists of three
      layers: the dance, the <em>nohkan</em>, and the percussion instruments.
      Notably, the <em>Kamimai</em> always includes the taiko drum, which
      articulates 16 strokes over an 8-beat measure using two sticks held in
      both hands. Once the taiko joins the ensemble, it leads the other
      musicians. The tempo is established, and transitions from one section to
      another are always indicated by the taiko player.
    </p>
    <p>
      As is consistent with Noh's instrumental dances categorized as
      <em>mai</em>, the core musical sequence of patterns in the
      <em>Kamimai</em> is called <em>Ji</em> or 'ground.' The
      <em>Ji</em> consists of four eight-beat segments:
      <em>Chū</em> ('central'), <em>Kan</em> ('high'), <em>Kannochū</em> ('high
      and central'), and <em>Ryō</em> ('low'). Each segment's
      <em>nohkan</em> melody usually begins on the second-and-a-half beat of its
      <em>honji</em>. However, in fast dances like the <em>Kamimai</em>,
      <em>nohkan</em> players often start the <em>Chū</em> and
      <em>Kannochū</em> segments on the second beat of their <em>honji</em>. As
      typical for <em>mai</em> instrumental dances, the sequence of these four
      patterns produces a melodic line shaped like a long wave, with the
      <em>Chū</em> pattern in the medium range, <em>Kan</em> rising to a higher
      range, returning to the medium range in <em>Kannochū</em>, before
      descending to the lower range in <em>Ryō</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Kamimai</em> consists of six sections: one
      <em>kakari</em> ('starting section') and five <em>dan</em> ('sections').
      In contrast to the <em>jonomai</em>, this dance does not include a
      <em>jo</em> ('introduction') section.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Kakari</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Kakari</em> is a noun derived from the verb <em>kakaru</em>, which
      means “to initiate” or “to get into something.” The <em>kakari</em> in
      <em>Kamimai</em> begins with two melody segments also named
      <em>kakari</em>. The second segment is identical to the segments called
      <em>dan</em>, played at the beginning of each section. These two segments
      named <em>kakari</em> are followed by two segments from the
      <em>Ji</em> pattern. Altogether, these four segments form the first part
      of the <em>kakari</em> section. Part 1 is then followed by the
      <em>Ji</em>, which is repeated four times in this <em>kakari</em> to
      complete the section.
    </p>

    <h3>Dan</h3>
    <p>
      The section's name comes from the nohkan's opening pattern called
      <strong>dan</strong>. The beginning of each <em>dan</em> can be recognized
      by an extended <em>’iya’</em> kakegoe by the taiko player.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <em>dan</em> includes two parts. <strong>Part I</strong> consists of a
      short sequence of new and recurring nohkan segments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Dan I - Part I</strong> has eight segments: <em>Dan</em>,
        <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, <em>Oroshi</em> (3 segments),
        <em>Kannochū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>. (cf. measure 17-24)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dan II - Part I</strong> has seven segments: <em>Dan</em>,
        <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Oroshi</em> (3 segments), <em>Kannochū</em>, and
        <em>Ryo</em>. (cf. measure 34-40)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dan III - Part I</strong> has ten segments: <em>Dan</em>,
        <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Oroshi</em> (6 segments), <em>Kannochū</em>, and
        <em>Ryo</em>. (cf. measure 55-64)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dan IV - Part I</strong> is slightly different and is composed
        of: <em>Dan</em> (2 segments), <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, where
        all segments are eight beats long except for <em>Dan</em>, which lasts
        sixteen. (cf. measure 55-40)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dan V - Part I</strong> has 3 segments, which do not include
        <em>Oroshi</em>: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>. (cf.
        measure 88-90)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All <em>Dan - Part II</em> consists of the repetition of <em>Ji</em> as
      found in the kakari section. The number of repetitions of
      <em>Ji</em> differs from <em>dan</em> to <em>dan</em>. Each
      <em>dan</em> also differs in which segment of <em>Ji</em> the Part II
      closes. At the end of all <em>mai</em> dance, the nohkan player makes it a
      rule to add one non-congruent melody named <em>Tome</em> (‘to close’)
      after the final segment of <em>Ji</em>.

    <p>
      A note regarding the <em>Oroshi</em> pattern: it is common for
      <em>Oroshi</em> segments in Part I to be performed at a slower tempo, as
      <em>Oroshi</em> means “to slow down.” However, in <em>Kamimai</em>, the
      players maintain tempo to preserve the vigor of the performance.
