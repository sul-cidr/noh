    <p>As its name signifies, <em>Kamimai</em> (meaning 'god dance') belongs to the category of <em>mai</em>, similar to the <em>jonomai</em> which appears in <em>Hashitomi</em>. It is an instrumental dance exclusively used for plays in the first category, featuring a god as the main dancer. The <em>kamimai</em> is known as the fastest of all the instrumental dances in Noh. Unlike other dances, such as <em>jonomai</em>, the <em>kamimai</em> does not include significant tempo changes during transitions from part to part. 

Like all instrumental dances, the <em>kamimai</em> consists of three layers: the dance, the <em>nohkan</em>, and the percussion instruments. Notably, the <em>kamimai</em> always includes the taiko drum, which articulates 16 strokes over an 8-beat measure using two sticks held in both hands. Once the taiko joins the ensemble, it leads the other musicians. The tempo is established, and transitions from one section to another are always indicated by the taiko player. 

As is consistent with Noh's instrumental dances categorized as <em>mai</em>, the core musical sequence of patterns in the <em>kamimai</em> is called <em>Ji</em> or 'ground.' The <em>Ji</em> consists of four eight-beat segments: <em>Chū</em> ('central'), <em>Kan</em> ('high'), <em>Kannochū</em> ('high and central'), and <em>Ryō</em> ('low'). Each segment's <em>nohkan</em> melody usually begins on the second-and-a-half beat of its <em>honji</em>. However, in fast dances like the <em>kamimai</em>, <em>nohkan</em> players often start the <em>Chū</em> and <em>Kannochū</em> segments on the second beat of their <em>honji</em>. As typical for <em>mai</em> instrumental dances, the sequence of these four patterns produces a melodic line shaped like a long wave, with the <em>Chū</em> pattern in the medium range, <em>Kan</em> rising to a higher range, returning to the medium range in <em>Kannochū</em>, before descending to the lower range in <em>Ryō</em>.

The <em>Kamimai</em> consists of six sections: one <em>kakari</em> ('starting section') and five <em>dan</em> ('sections'). In contrast to the <em>jonomai</em>, this dance does not include a <em>jo</em> ('introduction') section. 

<h2>Kakari</h2>
<p><em>Kakari</em> is a noun derived from the verb <em>kakaru</em>, which means “to initiate” or “to get into something.” The <em>kakari</em> in <em>kamimai</em> begins with two melody segments also named <em>kakari</em>. The second segment is identical to the segments called <em>dan</em>, played at the beginning of each section. These two segments named <em>kakari</em> are followed by two segments from the <em>Ji</em> pattern. Altogether, these four segments form the first part of the <em>kakari</em> section. Part 1 is then followed by the <em>Ji</em>, which is repeated four times in this <em>kakari</em> to complete the section.</p>

<h2>Dan</h2>
<p>The section's name comes from the opening pattern of the <em>nohkan</em> called <em>dan</em>. Each <em>dan</em> can be recognized by an extended <em>’iya’</em> <em>kakegoe</em> from the taiko player.</p>
<p>Each <em>dan</em> contains two parts. Part I consists of a short sequence of new and recurring <em>nohkan</em> segments:</p>

<p>There is a special note regarding the <em>Oroshi</em> pattern: it is common for <em>Oroshi</em> segments in Part I to be performed at a slower tempo, as <em>Oroshi</em> means “to slow down.” However, in <em>kamimai</em>, the players maintain tempo to preserve the vigor of the performance.</p>
