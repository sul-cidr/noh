      Unaccompanied vocal part delivered in

      <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken"><em>kotoba</em></a
      >. In style, this is similar to a
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/nanori"><em>Nanori</em></a
      >, but its narrative differs. The function of the <em>Nanori</em> is to
      identify the waki and explain the reason for his presence at the location.
      In a play, the Monologue comes at a time when the waki's identity and
      intentions are already known, thus its function is to introduce the coming
      action. In Kokaji's case, the waki mentions that he is going to pray at
      Inari Shrine.
