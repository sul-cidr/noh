    <p>
      The <em>Notto</em> is divided up into two parts: music and chant. The
      <em>Notto</em>-music is an introduction that is not only unsettling but
      also evocative. It is characterized by a percussion accompaniment in
      strict setting played by the kotsuzumi and the ōtsuzumi, and a
      non-congruent nohkan part. It always leads to the
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-chant" target="_blank"
        ><em>Notto</em>-chant</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kosuzumi’s steady eight-beat <em>notto uchi tsume</em> pattern is a
      signature feature of this <em>shōdan</em>. This pattern serves as a
      foundation superposed with various ōtsuzumi patterns and the non-congruent
      nohkan part composed of five segments:
    </p>
    <p>1- Hi-hya u-ta u-ta u-ta u-ta u-ta u-ta u</p>
    <p>2- Hyū i-ya</p>
    <p>3- Hiu ri-u</p>
    <p>4- Hi-hya uru ro-i ya</p>
    <p>5- O-hya i-cho uho-u</p>

    <p>
      The <em>Notto</em>-music is spread over seven <em>honji</em>, the
      beginning of the <em>Notto</em>-chant overlapping with the end of the
      nohkan solo.

    <p>
      The performance of an entrance music varies according to the action on the
      stage. In the play version, the nohkan player anticipated that he needed
      to extend the duration of the <em>Notto</em>-music, so he interjected a
      new pattern between the second and third one:
    </p>
    <p>O-hya ro-ru-ra</p>
