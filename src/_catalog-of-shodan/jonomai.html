    <p>
      This refined and calm dance, which can be performed by an old man
      character, is typically presented by female characters, as is the case
      with Hashitomi. Like all instrumental dances, the <em>Jonomai</em> has
      three layers: the dance, the nohkan, and the percussion instruments. The
      nohkan provides a cyclical melodic background, and through its recurring
      patterns articulates the dance’s five sections: <em>jo</em>,
      <em>kakari</em>, and three <em>dan</em>. The complete dance, as presented
      in the
      <a href="/hashitomi/jonomai/" target="_blank">full play recording</a>,
      includes five sections. However, some <em>Jonomai</em> include only two or
      even one <em>dan</em>. The name <em>jonomai</em> derives from the
      introductory section <em>jo</em>, which can be translated as “an
      introduction.”
    </p>

    <h3>
      Jo
    </h3>
    <p>
      The three <em>honji</em>-long section stands apart from the rest of the
      dance, as well as from most instrumental dances, as a section that
      includes a non-congruent nohkan part and percussion in flexible rhythm.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Kakari
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>Kakari</em> is the noun derived from the verb <em>kakaru</em>, which
      means “to initiate” or “to get into something.” In the context of the
      <em>Jonomai</em>, <em>kakari</em> could be understood as getting into the
      congruent-mode phase of the dance, which makes it the introduction's
      second step after <em>jo</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, the nohkan introduces the dance’s core sequence of
      patterns called <em>Ji</em> or 'ground.' The <em>Ji</em> will be used
      repeatedly in this and the remaining sections of the dance. It is composed
      of four eight-beat segments: <em>Chū, Kan, Kannochū,</em> and
      <em>Ryo,</em> where <em>Kannochū</em> is either a variation or repetition
      of <em>Chū</em>. Each segment begins on the second-and-a-half beat of its
      <em>honji</em>. The sequenced four patterns produce a melodic line whose
      shape is a four-<em>honji</em> long wave with the <em>Chū</em> pattern in
      medium range, <em>Kan</em> raising into higher range, then back to the
      medium range in the <em>Kannochū</em>, before reaching the lower range in
      the <em>Ryo</em>. The <em>Ji</em> pattern is played four times in this
      <em>kakari</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Dan
    </h3>
    <p>
      The section's name comes from the nohkan's opening pattern called
      <em>dan</em>. The beginning of each <em>dan</em> can be recognized by an
      extended <em>’iya’ kakegoe</em> by the ōtsuzumi player.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <em>dan</em> includes two parts. Part I consists of a short sequence of
      new and recurring nohkan segments:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Dan</em> I - Part I </strong>has five segments: <em>Dan</em>,
      <em>Kannochū</em>, <em>Oroshi</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Dan</em> II - Part I </strong>has an almost identical sequence
      of patterns except that the <em>Oroshi</em> is preceded by a <em>Ryo</em>.
      This results in the following sequence: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>,
      <em>Ryo</em>, <em>Oroshi</em>, <em>Kannochū</em>, and <em>Ryo</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first two <em>dan</em>, all patterns are eight-beats long except
      for the <em>Oroshi</em>, which lasts sixteen beats. <em>Oroshi</em> is
      also a unique moment of significant slowdown.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><em>Dan</em> III - Part I </strong>is slightly different, and is
      composed of the following: <em>Dan</em>, <em>Chū</em>, <em>Ryo</em>, where
      all segments are eight-beat long except for the <em>Dan</em>, which lasts
      sixteen.
    </p>

    <p>
      All <strong><em>Dan</em> - Part II</strong> sections are comprised of two
      <em>Ji</em> as heard in <em>kakari</em>, plus unique combinations of one
      or two additional segments.

    <p id="Oroshi">
      There is a special note on the <em>oroshi</em> pattern: it is not only the
      longest but also the slowest, since <em>oroshi</em> means “to slow down.”
      The <em>Jonomai’s</em> five sections are spread over sixty-four
      <em>honji</em>, as shown in this figure, where the Y-axis gives duration
      in seconds (the higher the peak the slower the tempo):
    </p>

    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/jonomai-tempo.png"
    %}

    <p>
      The figure shows that the five sections are merged into an overall
      accelerando that is relaxed in the first and second <em>dan</em>, where
      the highest peaks correspond to the two-<em>honji</em> long
      <em>Oroshi</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The beginning of Hashitomi's <em>Jonomai</em> is preceded by a one-<em
        >honji</em
      >
      bridge from the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Kuse</em>. The jiutai,
      accompanied by the two percussion instruments, introduces the first line
      of the poem Genji wrote in response to Lady Yūgao’s. The jiutai extends
      the poem’s last vowel over the next <em>honji</em>, overlapping with the
      beginning of the <em>Jonomai</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The instrumental version of the <em>Jonomai</em> included in this Catalog
      of <em>Shōdan</em> is abridged. It starts with the bridge from the
      <em>Kuse</em>, followed by the <em>Jo's</em> three <em>honji</em>, which
      leads to <em>Kakari</em> with four presentations of the
      <em>Ji</em> pattern.
