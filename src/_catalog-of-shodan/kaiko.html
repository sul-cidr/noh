     The chant known as <em>kaikō</em> is performed by the waki at the beginning of a first-category Noh play. The text typically celebrates a patron or current event and remains unrelated to the play's plot. <em>Kaikō</em> was commonly performed, for instance, at public ceremonies during the Edo Shogunate, at venues such as the Imperial Palace and the Honganji Temple. They  were crafted by scholars of the Shogunate, court nobles or temple priests. Contemporary performances of </m>kaikō</m> are extremely rare. The text of the example below was composed by Prof. Reiko Yamanaka for a performance commemorating the opening of the relocated Kyoto City University of Arts.
