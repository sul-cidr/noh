      The <em>Ageuta</em> chant starts in the higher range and finishes in
      either the medium or low range. It is sung by an actor, jiutai, or both an
      actor and jiutai. Based on poetic text with
      <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-R" target="_blank">regular</a> rhythm, it is set
      in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a
      >. Also, it is customary for the first line of text to be repeated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>Ageuta</em> is often composed of two parts clearly discernable by
      the nohkan’s material. In the first part, the nohkan player performs the
      <a href="/music/nohkan/takane" target="_blank"><em>takane</em></a> pattern
      during the
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
        ><em>uchikiri</em></a
      >, which separate the two iterations of the first line of text. In the
      second part, the nohkan player performs two patterns:
      <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"
        ><em>naka no takane</em></a
      >
      or a variation of it, and
      <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"
        ><em>mi roku no ge</em></a
      >. The first pattern is in the high register of the instrument whereas the
      second and last one starts in the medium range and finishes in the low
      range, mirroring the overall registral descent of the vocal line.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>Ageuta</em> is often used as the closing <em>shōdan</em> in the
      first act's "Waki- and Shite-enters" parts, as well as the first act
      itself.

    <p>Between the two plays there are five <em>Ageuta</em>.</p>

    title="Hashitomi – Ageuta 1" link="" paragraph1="The first
    <em>ageuta</em> in Hashitomi is sung in yowagin mode by jiutai accompanied
    by hayashi. It closes the first act." %}

    <p>
      Hashitomi’s first <em>Ageuta</em> featured on this video is sung by the
      jiutai accompanied by the <em>hayashi</em>. It closes the first act. It is
      short enough that the nohkan's part does not include a
      <em>naka no takane</em>. Its second one is also set for jiutai and
      <em>hayashi</em>. It closes the "Shite re-enters" part. It is shorter than
      the first one, thus the nohkan’s part includes only the
      <em>takane</em> pattern. This being said, in this production of Hashitomi,
      the <em>takane</em> is not performed in the second <em>Ageuta</em>. This
      is because it coincides with the removal of the drape around the
      <em>tsukurimono</em> that hides the shite. The nohkan's pattern has been
      left out to keep the focus on the appearance of the shite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kokaji’s first <em>Ageuta</em> is set for an actor (waki), jiutai, and
      <em>hayashi</em>. It closes the first act’s "Waki enters" part. Its second
      one set for jiutai and hayashi, closes the first act’s "Dialogue" part.
      Since it is the second <em>Ageuta</em> in the play, a
      <em>hishigi takane</em> pattern replaces the <em>takane</em>. Finally,
      Kokaji’s third <em>Ageuta</em> set for jiutai and <em>hayashi</em>, closes
      the first act’s "Shite exits" part. There is no
      <em>uchiriki</em> separating the first line from its repetition, so the
      nohkan player does not play the <em>takane</em> pattern. Although the
      <em>Ageuta's</em> second part usually includes nohkan music, it is not
      played when the first act closes with the exit music <em>raijo</em>, as it
      is the case with this production.
