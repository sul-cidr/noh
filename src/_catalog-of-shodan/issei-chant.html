      The introductory <em>Issei</em> Chant is usually but not exclusively sung
      by the shite. It is usually preceded by an entrance music, also called
      <em>Issei</em>, which we refer to as

      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/issei-music"><em>Issei</em> Music</a>

      to avoid confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      This
      <a href="/music/voices#Einori"><em>einori</em></a>

      chant is sung in the high register. In contrast with the recitative style
      of <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori"><em>sashinori</em></a> chant,
      <em>einori</em> chant is characterized by the prolongation of certain
      syllables and a vocal line whose contour is more dynamically shaped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually based on Japanese poetry, the text of the chant belongs to the

      <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-R">regular</a>

      category, with its syllabic structure of 5, 7-5, 7-5 or some variations of
      7 and 5. The text for Hashitomi’s <em>Issei</em> Chant though, comes from
      a Chinese poem by Emperor Saga (786-842), so its syllabic structure does
      not conform to this format. In fact, it is categorized under the

      <a href="/text/#Arhythmic">arhythmic</a>

      poetic text.

      The play <em>Takasago</em> features two examples of an
      <em>issei</em> chant, one in the first act and one in the second. The
      chant in the first act is a special version called
      <em>shin no issei</em> ('authentic' <em>issei</em>), which is distinct
      from a standard <em>issei</em>. It expands on the typical 5-7-5-7-5 poetic
      syllable structure by adding two more lines of seven and five syllables.
      This attached section, called the <em>ninoku</em> ('the second phrase'),
      is always initiated by the shitezure in a very high tone and at a quick
      tempo. The <em>shin no issei</em> is also usually accompanied by the
      nohkan.
