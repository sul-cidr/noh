      in
      <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a>
      style, it usually depicts scenes of prayer. Instrumental music also called
      <em>Notto</em>, precedes it, so we refer to it as
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-music" target="_blank"
        ><em>Notto</em>-music</a
      >
      to avoid confusion. The <em>Notto</em>-chant is sung in
      <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a>
      style, over a steady beat provided by the kotsuzumi.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the vocal part is non-congruent, it is not entirely detached from
      the strict percussion accompaniment. The waki uses the ōtsuzumi’s
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Otsu-strokes" target="_blank"
        ><em>chon</em></a
      >
      stroke on the third beat to position his declamation, so musicians often
      perform a rallentando controlled by the ōtsuzumi shortly before the third
      beat.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the most part, a complete sentence fits in the eight beats that
      separate two consecutive <em>chon</em> strokes. Longer sentences are
      spread over three or four consecutive <em>honji</em>. In this case, there
      is no rallentendo on the intermediate third beats, and instead the
      ōtsuzumi fills the intermediate <em>honji</em> with a sequence of five or
      six <em>chon</em> strokes.
