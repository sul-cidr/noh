      <em>Raijo</em> is solemn music played by the nohkan and three percussion
      instruments. It sometimes accompanies the exit of a deity at the end of
      the first act, as it is the case in Kokaji.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Raijo</em> is composed of two sections: The first one, called
      <em>nakairi-raijo</em>, is slow and non-congruent, creating a stately mood
      for the exit of one or two characters. The beginning of each eight-beat
      unit is articulated with a taiko
      <a href="/music/taiko/#Strokes" target="_blank"><em>dainobachi</em></a>
      stroke on the first beat, followed immediately with a
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Kotsu-strokes" target="_blank"
        ><em>ta</em></a
      >
      stroke on the kotsuzumi.
    </p>

    <p></p>

        </td>
      </tr>

    <p>
      The tempo picks up at the beginning of the second section, which is
      congruent. This one, called <em>kyōgen-raijo</em> accompanies the entrance
      of the ai-kyōgen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>kyōgen-raijo</em> tempo is faster, and the
      <em>kakegoe</em> shorter. Its lighter tone differs from the
      <em>nakairi-raijo’s</em> solemn feel. The structure of its steady
      eight-beats rhythmic pattern is divided into two equal parts, its second
      half repeating the first except for the kotsuzumi’s
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Kotsu-strokes" target="_blank"
        ><em>chi</em></a

      stroke on the 6th beat.

    <p>
      The non-congruent first part, which accompanies the exiting shite and
      waki, covers five <em>honji</em>. It is against the percussion’s static
      rhythm that the nohkan performs its eight-beat melodic pattterns, starting
      each one around the <em>honji's</em> second beat, playing mainly on even
      beats in contrast with the percussion strokes positioned largely on odd
      beats. The congruent second part, that support the ai-kyōgen’s entrance,
      is spread over four <em>honji</em> and a half.
