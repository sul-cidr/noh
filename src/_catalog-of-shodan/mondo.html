      <a href="/text/#Prose" target="_blank">Prosaic</a> conversation between
      the shite and waki in
      <a href="/music/voices/#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a

      identity.

      Between the two plays there are two <em>Mondō</em>, and both are in
      Kokaji. They provide examples of the declamation style, in which words are
      first delivered on a pulse that accelerates, as the pitch gradually
      glisses up. Towards the end of sentence, the pitch raises suddenly
      followed with a short descent, creating a melodic contour that embodies
      the
      <a href="/form/#Intro/" target="_blank"><em>jo-ha-kyū</em></a> principle.
      These 'melodic curves' follow the grammatical structure of the text, the
      peak being reached just before the end of the sentence. We bolded
      syllables in the excerpt to identify the higher pitch that triggers the
      following descent.

      Kokaji’s first <em>Mondō</em> is part of the ‘Waki enters’ section in the
      first act. Preceded by a <em>Nanori</em>, it maintains the
      <em>kotoba</em> style of delivery but the texture moves from one to two
      speaking voices. The dialogue is between a wakizure impersonating an
      authoritative emperor’s envoy, and a waki, the humble swordsmith Munechika
      Kokaji.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kokaji’s second <em>Mondō</em> occurs during the ‘Dialogue’ section in the
      first act, and it starts with a <em>yobikake</em>, a call from the
      distance. Although the curtain is lifted, the shite remains out of sight
      as he is heard calling out to the waki from the anteroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      This <em>Mondō</em> offers two points of comparison between a shite and
      waki’s <em>kotoba</em> styles. The first relates to the gradual rising
      tone. While they both use a rising line to get to a peak-tone, the overall
      ascent of the shite’s line is more subdued compared with the waki’s. The
      second point relates to the shite’s slower pace of delivery compared with
      the waki's. These two points are not to be understood as universal
      stylistic characteristics, but rather as play-related differences. The
      shite’s more stately style is better suited to a deity. The difference
      between the two styles helps set apart the divine being (shite) from the
      human (waki).
