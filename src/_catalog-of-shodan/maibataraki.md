    <p>
      <em>Maibataraki</em> is a virile and animated dance well suited for
      several types of characters, including dragon gods, goblins, or a deity
      appearing in Kokaji. Like all instrumental dances it has three layers: the
      dance, the nohkan, and the percussion instruments. The
      <em>Maibataraki</em> always includes taiko. The nohkan provides a cyclical
      melodic background, and through its recurring patterns it articulates the
      dance’s three parts: <em>kakari</em>, <em>ji</em>, and <em>dan</em>. The
      leading percussion instrument, the taiko uses its distinguishable
      <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a> pattern
      to articulate the beginning and closing of its rhythmic cycles, which are
      synchronized with the nohkan's patterns, thereby helping articulate the
      dance’s three sections.
    </p>

    <h3>Kakari</h3>
    <p>
      Translated as ‘initiating something,’ the <em>kakari</em> is used to set
      the dance’s dynamic and upbeat mood. It is spread over two eight-beat
      measures (<em>honji</em>). The taiko leading the percussion section opens
      and closes with a <em>kashira</em> pattern that clearly delineates the
      section’s boundaries.
    </p>

    <h3>Ji</h3>
    <p>
      <em>Ji</em>, or ‘ground’ is a section in which the nohkan player
      introduces a core sequence of segments. It consists of three labelled a,
      b, and c, in the video, each one lasting one <em>honji</em>. They have a
      clear melodic quality that contrasts with the opening rhythmic patterns.
      The sequence can be interrupted after any of the three segments to move on
      to the closing <em>dan</em> section. In this recording, the <em>Ji</em> is
      played twice, but the second time, segment 'c' is dropped as the ensemble
      starts the closing section after the segment 'b.' The duration of the
      <em>Ji</em> coincides with the taiko’s first cycle of patterns, clearly
      perceptible with its opening and closing <em>kashira</em> pattern.
    </p>

    <h3>Dan</h3>
    <p>
      The beginning and end of the last section of the dance are once again
      clearly marked by the <em>hayashi</em>. The nohkan starts the four-<em
        >honji</em
      >
      <em>dan</em> with two new one-<em>honji</em> segments that help mark the
      start of the section. They are followed by a return of its segment ‘a,’
      which leads to the cadential pattern <em>tome</em>. Its sequence of
      segments can be summarized with d, e, a, <em>tome</em>. The taiko helps
      articulate the beginning of the <em>dan</em> by dropping out during the
      first <em>honji</em> and creating a sudden decrease in density.
    </p>

    <p>
      To help appreciate the complexity between the <em>hayashi's</em> four
      parts, the <em>Maibataraki</em> is presented at three different speeds:
      the original, at 75%, and at 50% of the original speed.
