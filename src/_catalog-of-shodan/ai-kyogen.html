    <p>
      When a play is divided into two acts, the shite exits after the first one
      to change costumes and prepare for the second act. The time when the actor
      is off the stage is called <em>nakairi</em>. During this period, an
      interlude known as <em>Ai-kyōgen</em> is performed on the stage. It is not
      considered a <em>shōdan</em>.

      Typically, a kyōgen actor impersonating a local resident enters the stage
      and converses with the waki. Delivering his text in
      <a href="/text/#Prose" target="_blank">prose</a>, he summarizes the first
      act and provides some basic information leading into the second one, as is
      the case with Hashitomi. Less often, as it is in Kokaji, both the shite
      and waki exit. In this case, the entering kyōgen actor delivers a
      monologue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although less frequent, it is also possible for a kyōgen actor to appear
      within an act, in which case the interlude is performed by a different
      actor. Kanawa which opens with a scene featuring a kyōgen actor is a good
      example. In this case, the interlude between acts is performed by the
      wakizure.
