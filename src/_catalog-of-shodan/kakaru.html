      <em>Kakaru</em> means "to initiate" or "to get into something", which in
      this case refers to a transition from a spoken narrative to singing and
      music. It can mix <em>kotoba</em> and singing in non-congruent mode. Text
      in <a href="/text/#Prose" target="_blank">prose</a> either alternated with
      or is followed by
      <a href="/text/#Arhythmic" target="_blank">arhythmic</a> text set in
      <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a
      >. When switching from speaking to singing, a subtle expressive emphasis
      takes place in the first few sung words. <em>Kakaru</em> can be
      accompanied by the two drums in flexible mode but never by the nohkan.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Kakaru</em> typically follows a spoken dialogue like a
      <em>Mondō</em> or <em>Kakeai</em> and often leads to a congruent song such
      as an <em>Ageuta</em>. Also, serving as a bridge from a conversation, it
      is often sung antiphonally. The <em>shōdan</em> that follows is frequently
      sung by the jiutai, who takes over from shite and waki, and speak for them
      in one merged voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three <em>Kakaru</em> in Hashitomi presented below. The second
      is a typical one, whereas <em>Kakaru</em> one and three are monologues.
      However, all three share the function of preparing for a dramatic shift,
      such as the arrival of the shite. They are all either leading to or
      opening a new section: Shite Enters, Shite Performs and Shite Re-enters,
      respectively. The transitional quality of the <em>Kakaru</em> is also
      reflected in its percussion accompaniment, which is articulated with
      sparse
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
        ><em>mitsuji</em></a
      >
      pattern, with an increase of momentum towards the end, evidence in a
      switch to the pulsated
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"
        ><em>tsuzuke</em></a
      >
      pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Delivery in
      <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a> is
      recognizable by the declamation's rising tone, identified in the video
      with bold syllables. On the other hand, the vibrato associated with the
      singing mode helps identify the switching point between the two modes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the name <em>Kakaru</em> appears in the chanting books of most
      schools, the term is not normally adopted as a name of <em>shōdan</em> in
      Japanese academic context. Instead of <em>Kakaru</em>, the relevant
      segments are referred to as <em>Kakeai</em> (dialogue), <em>Sashi</em> or
      are given no name.

              Hashitomi’s first <em>Kakaru</em> is the last <em>shōdan</em> of
              the first act’s ‘Waki enters’ part. It is set for one actor
              accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a monologue presented by the waki, a monk living in
              <em>Unrin-in</em> Temple, who is performing a service for flowers
              as an offering to Buddha. After having made a factual statement
              about the flowers in <em>kotoba</em>, the waki switches to singing
              in
              <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin" target="_blank"
                ><em>yowagin</em></a
              >
              style, as he emotionally reflects on the lotus plant, since
              according to Buddhism, the heart of beings is like an unopened
              lotus.

              Hashitomi’s second <em>Kakaru</em> is the last <em>shōdan</em> of
              the first act’s ‘Dialogue’ part, leading to an <em>Ageuta</em>. It
              starts in chanting mode, switches to <em>kotoba</em>, and
              concludes in singing mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a dialogue between the waki and shite while the latter's
              identity is still unknown. (The waki is sitting further right, the
              shite between the waki and kotsuzumi player.) Both singing parts
              are in the higher range, sung in <em>yowagin</em>. The only spoken
              line in the dialogue is delivered by the shite's character, who
              cleverly evades answering the waki’s question about her name. The
              change of timbre let us understand that the shite's character is
              not yet ready to reveal her identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ambiguity about the shite's character identity is underlined
              by the two percussion instruments whose material spread over five
              eight-beat units heavily features the
              <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
                ><em>mitsuji</em></a
              >
              patterns whose sporadic strokes prevent the emergence of a
              definite pulse, creating a rhythmic ambiguity that matches the
              ambiguity of the shite's identity.

              Hashitomi’s third <em>Kakaru</em> is the sole <em>shōdan</em> of
              the second act’s ‘Waki waits’ part. It is entirely sung, so it
              compares well with a

                ><em>Sashi</em></a

              <em>Kakaru</em> does not include a nohkan’s part.
