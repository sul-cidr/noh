    <p>
      <a href="/text/#Prose" target="_blank">Prose</a> speech in which the
      character, usually the waki, identifies himself and explains the reason
      for his presence at the location. There are two <em>Nanori</em> between
      the two plays. They provide examples of the declamation style, in which
      words are first delivered on a pulse that accelerates, as the pitch
      gradually glisses up. Towards the end of sentence, the pitch raises
      suddenly followed with a short descent, creating a melodic contour that
      embodies the
      <a href="/form/#Intro/" target="_blank"><em>jo-ha-kyū</em></a> principle.
      These 'melodic curves' follow the grammatical structure of the text, the
      peak being reached just before the end of the sentence. We used bold
      syllables in the examples to identify the higher pitch that triggers the
      following descent.

              Hashitomi’s <em>Nanori</em> is delivered by a waki impersonating a
              traveling monk. Although the declamation style is customary, the
              way it is set to text varies. For instance, in Hashitomi's
              <em>Nanori</em>, the overall slower delivery and use of the lower
              register is well suited for a calm traveling monk. This is in
              clear contrast with the <em>Nanori</em> from Kokaji.

              Kokaji’s <em>Nanori</em> is delivered by a wakizure in the role of
              an Emperor’s envoy hastening to deliver an important order. It
              differs from Hashitomi’s <em>Nanori</em> in at least two ways: its
              delivery is much faster and the pitch higher, two distinctions
              well-suited for a messenger who is in a hurry to deliver an
              important missive.
