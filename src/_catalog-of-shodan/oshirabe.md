    <p>
      <em>Oshirabe</em> is a short musical piece heard before a play. The
      musicians perform it in the anteroom, separated from the audience by the
      lowered curtain. It announces that the performance is about to begin and
      establishes the expressive character of the play. The
      <em>Oshirabe</em> offers a transition from everyday life to the art of
      theater.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Oshirabe</em> means ‘to tune,’ and it refers to the musicians
      adjusting their instruments, so it is not considered an actual module
      (<em>shōdan</em>) of a play. The tuning is important because each
      percussionist reassembles his instrument right before a performance, and
      no sound-making is permitted behind the stage. It is the musicians' first
      opportunity to hear and adjust their instruments. The tuning does not
      involve attempts to match one another's pitch. Instead, the musicians tune
      to the play’s
      <a href="/about-intermedia/#Kurai" target="_blank"><em>kurai</em></a
      >, or its overall atmosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The performers sit in a prescribed order, facing the curtain: from left to
      right sit the nohkan, kotsuzumi, ōtsuzumi, and taiko, if one is used in
      the play. The musicians introduce the sound of the instruments one at a
      time. The nohkan player opens and closes the <em>Oshirabe</em> with the
      pattern: <em>ho ho ho fu fu</em>, interposed by the three patterns:
      <em>ho hya riu</em>, <em>ho hiu hiu</em>, and <em>ro ra riu</em>. The
      staggered entrance of the percussion instruments follows the seating
      order, so the kotsuzumi enters shortly after the nohkan, followed by the
      others.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three-part nohkan’s melody, with its first and third parts in the low
      range, middle one in its higher register, and the prescribed sequenced
      entrance of the percussion instruments, is common to all
      <em>Oshirabe</em>. But differences in its performance help set different
      moods. One obvious difference between Kokaji and Hashitomi’s
      <em>Oshirabe</em> is the timbre, since Kokaji's instrumentation includes a
      taiko, whereas Hashitomi's does not. Subtle differences can also help set
      distinct moods. For instance, the performance of Hashitomi’s
      <em>Oshirabe</em> in our recordings is longer than Kokaji’s by more than
      twenty seconds, suggesting that the musicians felt that longer durations
      were appropriate to set the mood for a play about a young woman or a
      flower, compared with shorter durations for a play featuring a dynamic
      deity. Because all <em>Oshirabe</em> consist of the same musical material,
      the audience can pick up on its unique, expressive inflection. After
      finishing and before entering the stage, the musicians bow to each other,
      reinforcing their unity as a group.
