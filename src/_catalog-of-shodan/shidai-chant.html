    <p>
      The introductory <em>Shidai</em>-chant is usually sung by the waki. It is
      often followed by a
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/nanori" target="_blank"><em>Nanori</em></a> or
      a <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/sashi" target="_blank"><em>Sashi</em></a
      >. Entrance music, also called <em>Shidai</em> usually precedes it, so we
      refer to it as
      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/shidai-music" target="_blank"
        ><em>Shidai</em>-music</a
      >
      to avoid confusion. In contrast with the congruent <em>Shidai</em>-chant,
      the <em>Shidai</em>-music is non-congruent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-R" target="_blank">regular</a> poetic text is
      composed of three lines, the second one being a repetition of the first.
      The syllable pattern is 7-5, 7-5, 7-4, or occasionally, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5. The
      first two lines are sung on high pitch, the third start on the medium and
      concludes on the low pitch.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no <em>Shidai</em> in the two plays featured on this website, so
      we represent it with a concert version of Atsumori’s <em>Shidai</em>. Sung
      by the shite, the <em>Shidai</em> closes with a <em>jitori</em> performed
      by the jiutai. When included, a <em>jitori</em> concludes the
      <em>Shidai</em>, repeating its second and third lines on a very low, quiet
      tone in a non-congruent fashion.
