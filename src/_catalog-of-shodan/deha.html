      This instrumental music is used for the entrance of the nochi-shite, usually a god, deity, or celestial being. As such, it is typically found in plays from the First Category. In addition to the nohkan, its instrumentation always includes the three percussion instruments: taiko, otsuzumi, and kotsuzumi.

<p>In Japanese numerology, odd numbers are considered lucky. Therefore, dates such as January 1st, March 3rd, May 5th, July 7th, September 9th, and November 11th are regarded as special days.</p> <p>In this Deha performance, the taiko's kashira pattern is used to clearly articulate the beginning of the shōdan’s five sections. The pattern is performed as follows: seven times at the beginning of the first section (measure 1, 1:18:47), five times at the beginning of the second section (measure 15, 1:20:46), three times at the beginning of the third section (measure 24, 1:21:49), two times at the beginning of the fourth section (measure 32, 1:22:36), and once at the beginning of the fifth section (measure 39, 1:23:09).</p>
