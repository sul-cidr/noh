  <p>The <em>Kakeai</em>, whose function is to move the plot forward, is an unaccompanied dialogue between the shite and the waki. However, it is sometimes accompanied by the two percussion instruments set in flexible mode. This is the case when it occurs between two energetic <em>shōdan</em>, and that the plot is already well established, as it is the case in Kokaji. Typically, <em>Kakeai</em> starts with <a href="/text/#Prose" target="_blank">prose</a> delivered in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a>, and concludes with unmetered sung verse with <a href="/text/#Arhythmic" target="_blank">arhythmic</a> text set in <a href="/music/voices#Sashinori" target="_blank"><em>sashinori</em></a>. Therefore, text corresponding to the switch of the mode of delivery is subtly emphasized. When unaccompanied, the singing mode in <em>Kakeai</em> gives more emphasis to words than the speech mode can.</p>

  <p>In Noh, the spoken mode tends to be used for conversations between characters in their immediate present. This changes once a character starts singing (usually in <em>sashinori</em>). The switch may suggest that he may now be in a world of his own such as a dream, in a solitary space, or just sharing a monologue. </p>

  <p>Between the two plays there are three <em>Kakeai</em>, one in Hashitomi and two in Kokaji. Hashitomi’s <em>Kakeai</em> is a typical example. It  opens the first act’s ‘Dialogue’ section, and is performed by two actors without accompaniment. At this point in the play, the shite standing at the second pine on the bridge, has just completed his entrance chant. The waki kneeling at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, performs a flower service for Buddha. It is in <em>kotoba</em> that he expresses his surprise when he notices a white flower he cannot name. The shite replies is in singing mode rather than in <em>kotoba</em>, and identifies the flower as <em>iugao</em>. This emphasizes the words and the flower’s name, an important clue to help reveal that the identity of the character played by the shite is possibly Lady Yūgao. The waki, staying in singing mode, asks the woman to identify herself. At this point, she switches back to <em>kotoba</em> to reaffirm her refusal to divulge her name but hints that she has come "from the flower’s shadow”.</p>


    <p>Delivery in <a href="/music/voices#Spoken" target="_blank"><em>kotoba</em></a> is recognizable by the declamation's rising tone, identified in the video with bold syllables. The switching point between the two modes can be identified by the introduction of the vibrato associated with the singing mode.</p>

    <p>Both Kokaji's <em>Kakeai</em> are short, standing between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>, functioning essentially as bridges. In both cases, the two percussionists who perform in the adjacent <em>shōdan</em>, continue to play in the <em>Kakeai</em>, but switch from a strict rhythmic setting for the adjacent <em>shōdan</em> to flexible for the performance of the <em>Kakeai</em>.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s first <em>Kakeai</em> is performed by two protagonists accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. Positioned between two congruent <em>shōdan</em> set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a>: the <em>Kuse</em> and the third <em>Ageuta</em>, it opens the first act’s ‘Shite exits’ part.</p>

    <p>Kokaji’s second <em>Kakeai</em> is also performed by two protagonists accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments. It opens the second act’s ‘Shite exits’ part, and is positioned between two congruent <em>shōdan</em>: the third <em>Noriji</em>, set in <a href="/music/voices#Onori" target="_blank"><em>ōnori</em></a>, and the <em>Kiri</em> set mainly in <a href="/music/voices#Chunori" target="_blank"><em>chūnori</em></a>.</p>
