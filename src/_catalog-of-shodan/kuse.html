<p> The name <em>Kuse</em> comes from a larger formal notion of <em>Kuse-mai</em>, or ‘<em>Kuse</em>-dance’. The <em>Kuse-mai</em> refers to a sequence of <em>shōdan</em>, the last of which is the <em>Kuse</em> proper. A typical <em>Kuse-mai</em> consists of six <em>shōdan</em>: <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/shidai-chant" target="_blank"><em> Shidai</em></a>,
<a href="/catalog-of-shodan/issei-chant" target="_blank"><em> Issei</em></a>, short dance such as an <em>Iroe mai</em>, <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/kuri" target="_blank"><em> Kuri</em></a>,
<a href="/catalog-of-shodan/sashi" target="_blank"><em> Sashi</em></a> and <em>Kuse</em>, which usually includes two solos lines sung by the shite. Kakitsubata is an example of a play with a full <em>Kuse-mai</em>. Yet, the majority of plays present variations of this model. When performed in the first act, the most common sequence consists of <em>Kuri</em>, <em>Sashi</em>, and <em>Kuse</em>, with the shite singing a single solo line. Kokaji's <em>Kuse</em> follows that model except that the shite has three solo lines. Hashitomi’s <em>Kuse</em> is the most abridged as it is a stand-alone <em>shōdan</em>, with the shite singing a single solo line.

</p>
  <p><em>Kuse</em> can be part of either act, which then may change some of its characteristicsis but it is always one of the most important <em>shōdan</em> of a play. There are several reasons for this status. The <em>Kuse</em> is among the most extended of the <em>shōdan</em>, focusing on the main actor and most importantly, it plays a key role in giving depth to the story or the main character and consequently to the play's formal development.</p>

  <p>The standard play starts with the waki arriving on stage and introducing himself. Then, the shite enters and sings a song that reveals nothing about his true identity, but sparks the waki's curiosity enough for a dialogue between them to follow. The waki questions the shite, trying to better understand who he is talking to. The <em>Kuse</em> typically describes events related to the shite's story or the context for it. The response is an indirect but rich poetical answer to the waki's questions.</p>

  <p> The <em>Kuse</em> is usually the first dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> of a play. When performed in the first act, often the shite remains seated for its entirety or its first part. A seated <em>Kuse</em> is called an <em>Iguse</em>. Danced <em>Kuse</em> occur more commonly in the second act, when energy and emotional engagement of the unfolded narrative are higher. In both cases though, the shite only starts dancing after having delivered his last solo line.  </p>

  <p>Regardless of the dance, the <em>Kuse</em> is first and foremost a long thematic chant. Set in <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a>, the rhythm of its poetic text is usually <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-I" target="_blank">irregular</a>, but can also be <a href="/text/#Rhythmic-R" target="_blank">regular</a>. The <em>Kuse</em> begins slowly in the lower range and finishes in the higher range, while its overall rhythmic structure moves from unstable to steady. This motion is controlled by the patterns of the two hand-drums whose ratio of <em>mitsuji</em> to <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns, initially favoring the sporadic <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> gradually gives way to the regular <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke</em></a> pattern. At the same time, the declamatory voice setting <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a> is gradually replaced with the steady <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a>. The metric structure (7+5) of the text synchronized with the percussion contributes to the change in overall expression from prosaic to poetic, shifting the emphasis from verbal to non-verbal.</p>

  <p><em>Kuse</em> is sung by the jiutai with the exception of a one or two solos, called <em>ageha</em>, performed by the shite, often followed by a nohkan's pattern that links the end of his verse with the return of the jiutai.  For instance, the sole <em>ageha</em> in Hashitomi's <em> Kuse</em> is immediately followed by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari" target="_blank"><em>takane mi kusari</em></a> pattern. As for the three verses in Kokaji, the nohkan follows the shite’s first <em>ageha</em> with the <em>takane mi kusari</em> pattern and marks the end of the second one with the <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi-takane" target="_blank"><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a>. The third verse is not followed by a nohkan’s pattern, as it marks the beginning of the dance.</p>
