    <h2 id="Intro">Shimai Dances</h2>
    <p>
      Using a jiutai limited to two members, the <em>shimai</em> version of
      Hashitomi and Kokaji’s <em>Kuse</em> and <em>Kiri</em> are presented from
      two different angles: front and side. Each dance is followed by our
      interpretation of its structure, where <em>kata</em> are grouped into
      segments, and where numbers refer to the stage’s
      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The shite's lines divide the text into sections, while sections are
      organized into parts according to the changing topics. Our structuring of
      the dance into sections matches with the text's. On the other hand, its
      sub-division into segments is based on <em>kata</em> that are known to be
      used as closing or opening movements, such as,
      <a href="/movement/single-stamp/" target="_blank">stamping</a>,
      <a href="/movement/opening/" target="_blank">opening</a>, closing, and
      reverse holding of the fan, the sequence <em>kata</em>
      <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Point</a> and
      Open retreat, among others. The analysis shows that parts and segments are
      often slightly out of phase. We speculate that avoiding 'cadencing' text
      and dance at the same time, might help maintain the dance's flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kokaji's <em>Kuse</em> is divided into two parts: The shite sits
      center-stage during the first part, and dances during the second one.
      Usually, only the second part is performed when presented as a
      <em>shimai</em>. We have included both parts to illustrate and stress the
      point that in a context of little motion, every simple
      <em>kata</em> carries meaning, may the movement be as simple as a sliding
      left or right, a head motion, raising on knee, and so on.
