            The primary actor and vocal soloist is usually masked. In some plays
            the shite has a companion actor called the
            <strong>shite-tsure</strong>, or just <strong>tsure</strong>, who
            can also be masked. Although the tsure can also dance, if only one
            actor dances it is the shite. The story revolves around him. At
            first, the audience knows very little or nothing about his true
            identity. Often, he is a character from another world, embodying,
            for example, a divine being or deceased person. In the latter case,
            and considering that most plays are composed of two acts, the
            first-act shite is often a spirit who has assumed the form of a
            person, while the second-act shite assumes the form of a the ghost
            or apparition of the same spirit.

            In traditional Noh repertoire the secondary actor is a realistic
            male character living in the narrative's present, therefore he is
            never masked. The audience usually knows who he is from the
            beginning since he typically introduces himself immediately after
            entering the stage. He engages the shite and provides him with a
            reason to appear and perform. Plays without a waki are exceptionally
            few. There are three major types of waki characters: a shrine
            official or retainer, a warrior, or, most commonly, a traveling
            monk. In some plays the waki has one or few unmasked companion
            actors called <strong>wakizure</strong>.

            It is in the early 17th century, that the chorus, called jiutai,
            became a permanent stage member. Originally, the shite and waki sang
            in unison what constitutes today's jiutai's part. The members of
            this group are not masked. Today's standard membership varies
            between six and ten performers. For selected academic examples found
            on this website, we have included a two-person jiutai. The role of
            the jiutai is to keep the story going, setting the scene, and
            describing the characters and actions. It does not have an identity
            of its own within the story. Singing in unison only, it can either
            act as a narrator or ‘speak’ for the shite or waki. Its first
            singing moment in a play, called <em>shodō</em>, always marks an
            important point in the play's development. The members of the jiutai
            are always from the same school as the shite.

            Often perceived as ‘assistant’, the kōken is in fact an important
            non-performing actor. The shite’s kōken is typically his senior and
            always from the same school. His active function is to oversee all
            stage activity, help with on stage costume changes when necessary,
            prompting in a normal voice if the shite forgets a line, and
            handling props. He also has the responsibility to take over should
            the shite be unable to complete the performance. Sitting in the back
            stage-right, the kōken provides the shite with an important
            anchoring presence on stage.

            Most plays are composed of two acts. The first one is usually
            concluded with the exit of the <em>mae-</em>shite (first-act shite).
            As he changes costume to transform into the <em>nochi</em>-shite
            (second-act shite) an ai-kyōgen performs an interlude between the
            two acts. Most often performing as an unmasked, realistic character,
            he often provides a summary of the first act and context for the
            second by engaging in a discussion with the waki. When an ai-kyōgen
            plays the role of a diety, he can be masked, as it is the case in
            Kokaji.
