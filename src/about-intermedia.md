        <h3>À propos</h3>

        <p>
          Intermedia works draw their expression from relationships between
          media. Typically, they combine two or more media layers. The layers
          may include: spoken or sung text, acting, visual staging, costume,
          movement, dance and music. Diverse and powerful examples of intermedia
          can be found across epochs and cultures: Wayang Kulit, Kunqu, Wagner’s
          operas, Fluxus Happenings, MTV or Bollywood, to name a few. Noh is one
          of the oldest and most elaborate among them. It was conceived as
          multilayered intermedia art form at its inception six centuries ago.
          Mainly transmitted orally ever since it has evolved but it has also
          retained most of its workings making it one of the oldest preserved
          and continuously performed forms of intermedia in the world. Not only
          it brings together multiple layers, each of which has been highly
          refined and plays a substantial role, but the correspondences between
          them are singular, intricate and wide-ranging. We believe that its
          essence and power is in a fascinating and unique intermedia language
          of expression that our project attempts to elucidate.
        </p>

        <p>
          This section of the website is devoted to the general characteristics
          of Noh as intermedia. It presents intermedia relationships seen in
          entire plays and repertoire overall. In-depth analysis focusing on
          intermedia in specific plays, acts, <em>dan</em> and
          <em>shōdan</em> are presented in other parts of the website. To
          support the discovery of intermedia in Noh in a bottom-up view, we
          offer also under
          <a href="/elements/" target="_blank">Elements of Noh</a> introductions
          to individual layers and their building blocks.
        </p>

        <p>
          To fully appreciate intermedia workings of Noh it is very helpful to
          understand its form. Noh’s structure consists of sections
          (<em>dan</em>) that represent common events of the dramatic
          development, which in turn are composed of modules (<em>shōdan</em>)
          of different but standardized function as well. Various forms of
          poetry, movement, rhythm, melodic shape and instrumentation help
          articulate these structures. With the
          <a href="/form/" target="_blank">form of Noh</a> being highly
          codified, an informed viewer can follow how intermedia articulate
          these structures, even when listening to a play for the first time. To
          help our readers orient themselves further and build useful intermedia
          expectations, we have developed visual representations of each play’s
          structure using an
          <a href="/form/#ITI" target="_blank">Intermedia Texture Index</a>
          (ITI). Its formula integrates information from multiple media layers
          into a <a href="/hashitomi" target="_blank">single graph</a>. To
          ground the viewers’ expectations in a more detailed way, the website
          offers also intermedia
          <a href="/hashitomi/ageuta-1/" target="_blank">‘scores’</a> for
          individual modules (<em>shōdan</em>). They provide notation for the
          intermedia layers of text, music, and dance. The viewers have the
          option of shaping their focus by activating in the scores all or any
          layers that they want to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          The style of performance is also intermedia in nature. Each of the
          layers is performed with inflections appropriate for a given play,
          role or circumstance. To bring into focus these styles and their
          expressive range we use side-by-side comparisons of video examples.
          One example is the
          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
            >comparison of rhythmic settings</a
          >
          of percussion instruments. These can show even the very subtle
          differences between distinct modes of singing, dancing or musical
          accompaniment that are related to particular character or situation.
          In performing arts in general but in Noh in particular it is not just
          the “what” but very much the “how” that matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, the idea to present Noh as intermedia required a new kind of
          publication. We opted for an audiovisual interactive format for two
          main reasons. Firstly, we considered it imperative that to explain
          intermedia we must include intermedia examples as audiovisual
          documentation. On our website, the readers have access to an extensive
          set of video illustrations with elements of Noh as well as two full
          plays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the interactivity or non-linearity of presentation gives the
          intermedia material a chance to be explored from multiple angles and
          with different depth that matches the needs of the reader and leaves
          more space for their own interpretation. For example, it is possible
          for a dance-focused reader to start with chapters about traditional
          <a href="about-movement" target="_blank">movement</a> elements in Noh
          or by customizing the score of a particular dance <em>shōdan</em> to
          feature information about its sequence <em>kata</em>. With this
          information they can then approach a larger intermedia context. We are
          aware that analysis of intermedia is extremely time consuming. Just to
          discuss the impact of music, one could address fluctuations in tempo,
          rhythmic organization, pitch motion and range, styles of delivery and
          more. Accounting for all expressive dimensions in all media and
          analyzing the complete network of intermedia relationships is
          prohibitively complex and perhaps impossible. Interactivity enables
          therefore exploration of Noh as intermedia in a more intuitive and
          personal way that fits the experience and interest of the readers.
        </p>

        <h3 id="noh-as-intermedia">Noh as Intermedia</h3>
        <p>
          How Noh is put together as intermedia is intricate, original and
          somewhat of a paradox. Despite significant independence of media
          layers, their individual sophistication and specialization, they
          cohere to a great expressive unity. Heterogenous materials that often
          function in loose synchronicity seem inseparable as intermedia and fit
          together like a glove. To help explain what is behind this artistic
          feat, several guiding principles can be identified. Not surprisingly,
          several can be traced back to the general context in which Noh came to
          being – the culture of the samurai, Japanese Buddhism and Chinese
          philosophy. But it is a great testament to the ingenuity of Noh
          artists that while applying and engaging deeply with ideals of their
          time they created an art that is timeless.

        <h4 id="breath">
          The Breath of Yin and Yang
        </h4>
        <p>
          Mostly metaphorically but also literally, ‘breath’ is one of the
          primary unifying elements of Noh. It is the central model for the
          form. The recurring cycle of inhaling/building-up energy and
          exhaling/releasing it, can be found underlying the flow of Noh on all
          structural levels. One could visualize Noh as a fractal design with
          ‘breath’ as its basic element. It repeats over and over in every
          possible time-scale and media layer to create an infinitely complex
          highly self-similar form. Conceptually, ‘breath’ can also be seen as
          reflecting the ancient Chinese philosophical tradition that describes
          the world as a constant balancing of Yin (dark, moon, female, inhale)
          and Yang (bright, sun, male, exhale). According to this philosophy,
          the two seemingly contrary forces are complementary, inseparable and
          depend on each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breath is foundational for noh actors. In most literal way they
          develop a special kind of lower abdomen (<em>hara</em>) breathing that
          is similar to that of Japanese martial artists. They learn that
          precise control of breath is essential to convey appropriate
          expression of the chant as well as posture and movement of the body.
          It underlies the rhythm of <em>kata</em>. From the basic walking step
          to circling around the stage with a group of <em>kata</em>, they
          follow the energetic and spatial shape of a breath.
        </p>
        <p markdown="1">
          Mastering breath is crucial for the drummers as well. One kind of
          breath is very particular. The <em>komi</em> [^1] is a breath that is
          taken in silence without striking a drum but it is also the beginning
          of drumming patterns. It consists of a sharp rhythmic inhale and
          holding it deep in the abdomen for a while. After the build-up of
          internal energy through the <em>komi</em> a vocal call breaks the
          silence and leads to a release by a strike. The sequence of a
          <em>kakegoe</em> shout followed by a drum-hit is ubiquitous in Noh and
          can be viewed as an Yin and Yang pattern of its own.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a slightly higher formal level of the eight-beat unit
          <a href="/music/#Rhythm" target="_blank"> (<em>honji</em>)</a>, a
          common oscillation exists between the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi. Ōtsuzumi
          leads in the first half of the honji and is answered by the kotsuzumi
          in the second half. On the next level, when looking at the
          construction of a shōdan, there is often an alternation of sparse,
          rhythmically flexible
          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
            ><em>mitsuji</em></a
          >
          patterns with the more dense and decisive
          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"
            ><em>tsuzuke</em></a
          >. Following the same ‘breath’ model a typical short shōdan involves
          gradual acceleration of rhythm and a build-up that leads in the second
          half to a resolution, sometimes accompanied by an entrance of the
          nohkan, ending in a brief slowdown (like in
          <a href="/kokaji/sashi/" target="_blank"><em>sashi</em> of Kokaji)</a
          >. Longer and more complex shōdan may consist of more than one
          ‘breath’. The principal sections of a <em>jonomai</em> dance called
          <em>dan</em>, hold within them a special moment of significant
          deceleration called
          <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai/#Oroshi" target="_blank"
            ><em>oroshi</em></a
          >. Musicians talk about it as of a ‘stream reaching a pond.’ These
          slowdowns apply not just to music but also to dance, which at that
          time halt to a standstill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The typical energetic trajectory of a large-scale dan (group of shōdan
          in an act) matches the same pattern: gradual extended acceleration and
          build-up followed by a fast closure with a short but palpable
          slow-down. Often, this maps also onto a pattern, in which the earlier
          parts of the dan use more prose recitation and
          <a href="/music/voices/#Non-congruent" target="_blank"
            >non-congruent</a
          >
          chanting while the later ones involve more poetry and
          <a href="/music/voices/#Congruent" target="_blank">congruent</a>
          chant. Further, even each of the two acts creates its own gradual
          build-up that resolves with a fast movement that closes with a
          slowdown. The play as a whole also shows the same pattern with the
          second act raising the tempo and energy further beyond the first,
          reaching the most cohesive section and closing with an ‘exhale’.
        </p>

        <p>
          The parallel changes of tempo bring about the issue of synchronization
          between performers. In most sections of Noh, there is no attempt
          between performers to adhere to a shared and regular pulse. The actors
          and musician meet at intervals marked by larger units akin of
          breathing cycles. On that level of time there can be a strong and
          sometimes very direct correlation of actions. The most important
          reference for the shite are the patterns of ōtsuzumi. To illustrate,
          at several points in the <em>Jonomai</em> the
          <em>uchi-hanashi</em> pattern of the ōtsuzumi serves as a signal to
          continue with the next sequence of movements. The pattern consists of
          a silent “tsu” on beat 8, “chon” on beat 1 and an extended kakegoe
          “yo” from beat 2 and half on. The interactions can be observed in the
          following three examples:
          <a
            id="jono1"
            href="#0"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:05:05,01:05:27&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in the <em>kakari</em> section</a
          >, at the point when the shite is facing front at Square 3, the
          pattern "tsu-chon" stops the dancer while the “yo” vocal call signals
          him to turn left and start to walk across the stage;
          <a
            id="jono2"
            href="#0"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:10:29,01:10:50&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in the first <em>dan</em></a
          >, similar stop and start occurs on Square 2 leading to walking across
          the stage; and
          <a
            id="jono3"
            href="#0"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:13:51,01:14:08&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in the second <em>dan</em></a
          >
          the dancer at Square 4 and synchronizes with
          <em>uchi-hanashi</em> pattern to stop and turn to the right to walk
          backward.
        </p>
        <p>
          As to the synchronization with the nohkan, the actors are aware of its
          importance in underlining emotions in crucial moments, outlining form
          or embellishing the music but many do not know what melodic patterns
          and when would be played. Unlike the attention that they give to the
          strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> of the ōtsuzumi they do not need to
          follow specific notes of the nohkan. There is however an interesting
          parallel between the rhythmic flow of dance routines and that of
          non-congruent flute playing. Both the nohkan phrases and sequences of
          kata are shaped as breaths and preceded by breaths. Even if not
          strictly synchronized, the intermittent action and resting creates a
          uniform energetic stream. The overlapping of nohkan patterns over
          adjacent dance routines creates a connection between them while
          retaining a highly desired fluidity.
        </p>
        <p markdown="1">
          From the point of view of an actor, the Yin and Yang dichotomy is
          important in two ways. First, it helps guide them in creating a
          dramatically effective fluctuation in time. Second, it dictates that
          characters or situations that represent one aspect must also offer the
          other. This brings out depth and subtlety in their acting. A common
          instruction states: ‘in rain, be bright; during the day, be calm.’ As
          the actor Tastushige Udaka told us[^2], ‘you should imagine that you
          are dancing even if you are sitting still.’ Mastery of acting in Noh
          is not about literally portraying extreme emotions but about evoking
          them in powerful but subtle way.
        </p>

        <h4 id="fluidity">
          Fluidity of Time, Space and Identity
        </h4>
        <p>
          Striving for a Yin and Yang equilibrium is also one of the causes that
          all in Noh is always fluid and gradual. The timing of events within
          individual layers as well as synchronization between them is in large
          parts intuitive and flexible. Regular and shared beats are reserved
          for certain important moments of intense focus and are arrived at
          smoothly, almost imperceptibly. The performers are interconnected,
          watch and listen to each other and maintain an intermedia flow but
          often without the need to synchronize strictly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drummers take the <em>komi</em> together but its duration is
          flexible and depends on the individual. The following beat is
          approximate and the kakegoe that precedes it is freely extended to
          match more general expressive needs. Many sections and layers of noh
          are in non-congruent and
          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
            >flexible rhythmic setting</a
          >. Even when percussionist start coordinating pulse in a
          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
            >strict rhythmic setting</a
          >
          it does not mean that the chant or nohkan will join it. The
          <a href="/hashitomi/jonomai/" target="_blank"><em>jonomai</em></a> or
          <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"
            ><em>maibataraki</em></a
          >
          dances that see all instruments rhythmically aligning are rare and
          serve as a climax. But even there, the dance is only loosely
          synchronized with the musical beat. When the musicians reach the
          <em>oroshi</em> the dancer will end up stopping entirely but there is
          no strict beat when that needs to happen. This is because the flow of
          energy that underlies the movement of bodies on stage is equally
          fluid. Even angular or sudden gestures result from an internal control
          that is continuous and 'smooth'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fluidity of the aesthetic form is an ideal expression of the
          fluidity of content. The minimalism of staging or even lack of literal
          references to particular locations allows for the space to be
          malleable and constantly redefined. Like in Kokaji, a few hints in the
          text allows viewers’ imagination to adapt and turn the imperial palace
          into Munechika’s home, workshop or road to Inari Shrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding to the fluidity is the polyvocality of text and transfer of
          identity between shite, waki and jiutai. The main actor can speak as a
          narrator, share a description, quote a poem, enter into a dialog with
          other characters and deities, and communicate their inner thoughts.
          Moreover, their voice can be transferred too. An example of it is
          found at the beginning of Kokaji’s first <em>ageuta</em>. Typically,
          the first line of text of an <em>ageuta’s</em> is presented by the
          shite and then repeated. If the repetition is done by the jiutai it
          implies that it took over the communication of the thoughts of the
          main character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Noh plays’ plots unfold around the identity of the shite. The
          audience is invited to discover who they are and empathize with them.
          According to Buddhist doctrine identity is an illusion and Noh is
          based on this premise. In mugen Noh plays, which are considered by
          many its artistic pinnacle, what we see could very well be a dream or
          illusion seen by the waki. The main character appears in the first act
          as a ghost hiding in the body of someone whom the waki could normally
          encounter in the dramatic present. By the end of first act we may
          learn the true identity of the original host of the spirit but when
          they return in the second act they remain a mere spirit (not the
          historic living person they once were). They are on the journey to
          enlightenment and like we can see in Hashitomi, they may not even know
          anymore whether they are a spirit of a woman or of a flower. The
          fluidity of expressive means discussed above, is a perfect reflection
          of this fluidity of identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping in mind this instability of identity it is interesting to
          observe how it can be gradually constructed by intermedia. In
          Hashitomi, when the shite appears the first clue is visual. The actor
          wears a mask of a young elegant woman and a costume that depicts
          flowers along fences. The movement is graceful and slow. Since the
          waki has spoken of performing a mass for flowers it is equally
          possible that the main character is a spirit of a flower or a village
          woman. The text sung by the shite in Rongi gives the name Yūgao but
          because it is a common flower name the identity remains ambiguous. The
          name becomes a woman’s nickname as the play progresses. Associations
          with Genji’s lover Lady Yūgao are made in the story told during the
          kyōgen and in the following shōdan. The dance that imitates her when
          Genji talks about Lady Yūgao establishes the most direct connection.
          It is through intermedia that the richness of the identity is created.

        <p>
          Intermedia, by immersing all senses can help imitate reality but
          theatrical traditions differ in the level of realism of
          representation. Noh is strongly on the abstract side of the spectrum.
          Its acting is highly formalized. The actors’ face is covered with a
          mask that prevents them from showing any direct emotion. Their
          movement and dance comes from a prescribed vocabulary of aestheticized
          kata, only some of which are even symbolically mimetic. Their speech
          is recited or chanted using standardized patterns that are shared
          between all plays without regard to their different stories. The
          ‘voice’ of the protagonist is frequently separated from their body,
          being transferred to the jiutai. The costumes match categories of
          characters by defining their gender, profession, and rank, with
          garments, colors and patterns that are strictly prescribed by
          tradition. The stage props are symbolic and often limited to just one
          placed centrally. The music is composed from a fixed collection of
          rhythmic and melodic patterns that are reused within and between
          different plays. The text is the only element that is original for
          each play but even there, the language is formal, quotations from
          poetry are prevalent and the plot itself is minimal.

          The combination of all of these abstract intermedia elements is that
          it forces the audience to be more active, to project their thoughts
          and own their meaning. Similar to reading a book, when watching a Noh
          play one gets engrossed by artful narrative of ‘clues’ for one’s own
          act of imagining. The Noh mask epitomizes this projection. It allows
          one to piece together the ambiguity and richness of information from
          multiple dimensions into it. Because Noh is about contemplation of a
          character the best plays and performances make the viewers attain
          profound empathy with the protagonist. In such plays the climax of the
          experience is not some dramatic twist of a plot but the abstract dance
          with all of the musicians including the nohkan performing in rhythmic
          synchronicity. When words cease, having done their part, we are left
          with the pure spirit, beautiful and vulnerable to our gaze.

          <em>Kurai</em>
        </h4>

        <p>
          Noh actors and musicians often use the word <em>kurai</em>, which
          literally means ‘rank.’ The word was originally used to categorize
          plays according to main character’s social status, dignity, and age. A
          higher <em>kurai</em> demands more subtlety and solemnity in all
          aspects of performance. It uses the most refined quality of masks and
          costumes, the pitch of the chant and <em>kakegoe</em> of drummers is
          lower and expressively more grave, and the tempo of music and dance is
          slower. On the contrary, lower (lighter) <em>kurai</em> does not
          demand as much subtlety and solemnity. Hashitomi and Kokaji are
          regarded as lighter in <em>kurai</em>. They feature young characters
          as protagonists; the plays are rather short; the dramatic themes are
          not particularly serious. Consequently, they have been included in
          introductory repertoire appropriate for young actors and musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this usage, Noh actors and musicians use <em>kurai</em> to
          identify the expressive style of performance. In this case the word
          refers to the atmosphere created by protagonist’s character, emotions,
          and dramatic setting such as season and time of day. An actor or
          musician may say ‘Let’s perform this music and dance in Hashitomi’s
          <em>kurai</em>. Listening to this, other actors and musicians can
          immediately understand what is the proper tempo, timbre, gravity and
          atmosphere of the music and dance. They just need to imagine
          Hashitomi’s protagonist, a ghost of young lady (or a flower) who, in
          the evening of an autumn day somewhat happily tells a story of the
          encounter with a noble man, Genji. The intermedia nature of
          <em>kurai</em> and its primal importance is one of the main keys to
          understanding Noh as intermedia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's illustrate <em>kurai</em> with concrete examples. Act Two of
          Hashitomi includes a section named <em>Jonomai</em>, an instrumental
          dance without text or singing. The same dance is also performed in
          other plays such as Izutsu, Nonomiya and Eguchi featuring women that
          are older and with different life experience. The style of performance
          differs between them reflecting each protagonist’s age and
          circumstnaces. If their mind is filled with grief or sadness,
          musicians and actors must adjust the music and dance accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of <em>kurai</em> can also be found in the way
          musicians and dancers perform the same patterns in different contexts.
          The main section of the
          <a href="/hashitomi/jonomai/" target="_blank"><em>Jonomai</em></a>
          dance is among others accompanied by the nohkan playing a fixed
          sequence of melodic patterns. The same patterns, however, are used in
          the
          <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"
            ><em>Maibataraki</em></a
          >
          dance in the second act of Kokaji, which features as protagonist a
          lively god. Although both use the same melodies, the <em>kurai</em> of
          both is enitrely different. Also the choreography of the first section
          (<em>kakari</em>) of both dances is almost the same. The shite steps
          from square 1 to 3, turns left and goes to 5, then 5 to 1 and performs
          a ‘circlet point’. The sequence takes place from sentence 7 to 17
          <a
            id="jono1"
            href="#0"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:04:21,01:07:46&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in <em>Jonomai</em></a
          >, and from sentence 3 to sentence 8
          <a
            id="jono1"
            href="#0"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/kokaji/#t=00:53:29,00:53:51&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in <em>Maibataraki</em></a
          >. As you may see, The two dances are different in tempo, size of
          steps and dynamics that appropriately evokes each protagonist’s
          character and their life circumstances.

          Recognizing the proper <em>kurai</em> helps the performers achieve a
          better level of synchronization (or sharing of the yin-yang breath) of
          music and dance. As we may find in the
          <a href="/form/#ITI2" target="_blank">ITI ranking list</a>, the
          ‘non-congruent’ rhythm, which does not follow the standard 8-beat
          frame, and flexible drumming, which does not clearly present 8-beat
          strokes, occupy a large part of Noh drama. Also, in the first stage of
          learning, each part is taught without any reference to the other
          parts. Dancers are taught only how to follow a fixed sequence of
          <em>kata</em> (prescribed movement) but not the music to which they
          will ultimately need to fit their dancing. Singers make it a rule to
          practice their singing without any reference to drum beats. The unique
          Noh pedagogy creates a path to “synchronization” or “congruency” on a
          higher level by introducing the <em>kurai</em> as something that
          connects all parts together. <em>Kurai</em> guides the process of
          combining media layers that would otherwise be "incongruent". The
          importance of the intermedia congruency is beautifully described by
          the actor, UDAKA Tatsushige when he stated: “If there is no nohkan
          playing in a <em>Kuse</em>, it is as if the peaks of the mountains
          were lost”.

          Noh is an intermedia art form of great expressive coherence. It
          breaths Yin and Yang as if in a fractal design. Through the fluidity
          of intermedia materials it embraces the impermanence of things and
          people. The abstract quality of its forms invites the audiences to
          engage deeply and become part of a rich and unique intermedia
          experience of Noh.
