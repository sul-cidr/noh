    <h2>Elements of Noh</h2>
    <p>
      To better appreciate the intermedia dimensions of Noh, it is helpful to
      know about its structure, and the expressive possibilities of its
      individual elements. In addition to the relevant chapters developed for
      this website, which are mainly focused on elements found in the two
      analyzed plays, the reader can refer to the affiliated
      <a href="https://jparc.online/nogaku/"> website 'Nōgaku' </a> at the
      Japanese Performing Arts Research Consortium
      <a href="https://jparc.online/"> (JPARC)</a> where more information in a
      wider context is provided.
