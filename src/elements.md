    <h2>Elements of Noh</h2>
    <p>To better appreciate the intermedia dimensions of Noh, it is helpful to know about its structure, and the expressive possibilities of its individual elements. In addition to the relevant chapters developed for this website, which are mainly focused on elements found in the two analyzed plays, the reader can refer to the affiliated <a href="https://jparc.online/nogaku/"> website 'Nōgaku' </a> at the Japanese Performing Arts Research Consortium <a href="https://jparc.online/"> (JPARC)</a> where more information in a wider context is provided.</p>
