    The intermedia texture is extremely simple. The waki stands up and walks to
    deliver a monologue from Square 1, the most common and quietest position
    used by an actor for a first address to the audience.

    In an inconspicuous way, it is this unmetered and unaccompanied monologue
    that will provide the shite with a reason to enter. More specifically, it is
    by stating that he will seek
    <time datetime="00:11:32.000" title="00:11:32">divine help</time> that the
    swordsmith has set up the context for the deity's appearance.
