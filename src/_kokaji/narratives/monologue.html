  <p>The intermedia texture is extremely simple. The waki stands up and walks to deliver a monologue from Square 1, the most common and quietest position used by an actor for a first address to the audience. </p>

  <p>In an inconspicuous way, it is this unmetered and unaccompanied monologue that will provide the shite with a reason to enter. More specifically, it is by stating that he will seek <time datetime='00:11:32.000' title='00:11:32'>divine help</time> that the swordsmith has set up the context for the deity's appearance. </p>
