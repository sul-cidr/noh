The shite takes the blade, performs a few <em>kata</em> holding it prominently then brings it to the envoy while the waki watches them.

  <p>The final <em>shōdan</em> of the play involves active dance, congruent singing, strict percussion and striking closing pattern by the nohkan. This brings the Intermedia Index to its second highest point. The mimetic movement matches the text, and the fast and intense music underlines the climactic character of the section. </p>

  <p>The <em>kiri</em> can be divided into three parts: introduction of the sword as 'Clustering Clouds of Heaven', boasting of its powers as it is offered to the envoy, and the deity’s exit.</p>

  <p>To proclaim the name of the sword with emphasis, a four-beat <em>toriji</em> measure is inserted. It interrupts the steady flow of <em>honji</em> and allows to precede the name “<em>Ama no murakumo…</em>” (<time datetime='00:56:57.000' title='00:56:57'>Clustering Clouds of Heaven...</time>)” with a pause that precisely stresses these words. The sword is demonstrated proudly by the deity by performing the standard sequence of <em>kata</em>:  <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, while holding the blade up high at arm's length.</p>

  <p>Second part begins with the deity looking at the sword held between stretched arms and <time datetime='00:57:11.000' title='00:57:11'>pronouncing: 'First under heaven'</time>. After repeating the claim the jiutai tells about the protection and blessings that the sword will bring. The dance’s momentum picks up and it will not abate until the end of the <em>kiri</em>. The shite starts by reinforcing the statements with a series of powerful <a href="/movement/ six-and-seven/" target="_blank">Six and Seven Stamps</a> that produces a <time datetime='00:57:19.000' title='00:57:19'>dynamic counterpoint with the melodic line</time>. The text that follows speaks of ruling the land to the four seas and abundance of the five staple crops. It is mimicked with the loosely synchronized sequence of formal <em>kata</em>: <time datetime='00:57:40.000' title='00:57:40'>Pointing and Large Circle </time>. As the jiutai sings “<em>Inari no shintai Kogitsune-maru wo/The manifestation of Inari: the Little Fox</em>”, the shite prepares to formally deliver the blade by performing an <time datetime='00:57:52.000' title='00:57:52'>Open-retreat</time> that brings him back to Square 1. In a moment filled with intensity, the deity holding the sword with two hands, walks forward to the Emperor's envoy, hands it to him, and moves back to Kneel and Bow.</p>

  <p>The final section of the text starts with "<em> kore made nari to ii-sutete/Now, I am done!</em>", and brings a change of tone created by a <time datetime='00:58:07.000' title='00:58:07'>sudden spike in tempo</time> of both music and dance. The deity stands up and performs several <time datetime='00:58:15.000' title='00:58:15'>virtuosic</time> <em>kata</em> with spectacular agility: Two Large Steps, <a href="/movement/leap-turn/" target="_blank">Leap Turn</a>, and a sequence of <a href="/ movement/multiple/" target="_blank">Kneeling</a> that mimic the words “<em>mata mura-kumo ni tobi-nori/he leaps upon the mass of clouds</em>.
  The closing nohkan’s <em>tome no te</em> pattern confirms the finality of the situation as the deity moves with determination to the 2nd Pine on the Bridge.Again he takes Two Large Steps in preparation for a Leap Turn, <time datetime='00:58:26.000' title='00:58:26'>illustrating his return to Mt. Inari</time>, over the words “<em>Higashiyama Inari no mine ni zo kaerikeru/and returns to the Eastern Peak of Mt. Inari!</em>. Finally, the deity flips his Left sleeve over his head to indicate disappearance from view, while Munechika keeps his gaze into the distance, as if seeing the diety off.</p>
