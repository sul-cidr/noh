  <p> The <em>noriji-2</em> functions as an introduction to the dance. In fact, the <em>noriji</em> with its immutable <em>honji</em> of limited number of syllables, often leads to a dance, as it is the case here. The main feature of this <em>shōdan</em>  is the shite’s grandiose entrance on the main stage supported by the full <em>hayashi</em> and the jiutai, who speaks for the deity.</p>

  <p>Yet, the <em>noriji-2</em> begins with an introduction that further delays the shite’s entrance on the main stage. Still standing at the First pine, the shite signals that he is about to make his move with a sequence of <a href="/movement/six-stamps/" target="_blank">Six Stamps</a>, that he concludes with a Left Turn, a <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>, and its usual companion <em>kata</em>, the <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, leading to the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/takane-hane" target="_blank"><em>takane hane</em></a> pattern, which concludes the introduction. </p>

  <p> The shite finally <time datetime='00:52:50.000' title='00:52:50'>enters the stage</time> with a <a href="/movement/large-zigzag/" target="_blank">Large Zigzag</a> performed in the dynamic Martial style. At the conclusion of this <em>kata</em>, the deity faces Munechika as the jiutai intones "<em>The appointed time for forging is known</em>", pressing him to get started with his task. </p>

  <p> From this point on, the shite performs a sequence of <em>kata</em> that brings him to Square 1, where he concludes the <em>shōdan</em> with the standard sequence: <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>. </p>
