    The <em>noriji-2</em> functions as an introduction to the dance. In fact,
    the <em>noriji</em> with its immutable <em>honji</em> of limited number of
    syllables, often leads to a dance, as it is the case here. The main feature
    of this <em>shōdan</em> is the shite’s grandiose entrance on the main stage
    supported by the full <em>hayashi</em> and the jiutai, who speaks for the
    deity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, the <em>noriji-2</em> begins with an introduction that further delays
    the shite’s entrance on the main stage. Still standing at the First pine,
    the shite signals that he is about to make his move with a sequence of
    <a href="/movement/six-stamps/" target="_blank">Six Stamps</a>, that he
    concludes with a Left Turn, a
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>, and
    its usual companion <em>kata</em>, the
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, leading
    to the nohkan’s
    <a href="/music/nohkan/takane-hane" target="_blank"><em>takane hane</em></a>
    pattern, which concludes the introduction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shite finally
    <time datetime="00:52:50.000" title="00:52:50">enters the stage</time> with
    a
    <a href="/movement/large-zigzag/" target="_blank">Large Zigzag</a> performed
    in the dynamic Martial style. At the conclusion of this <em>kata</em>, the
    deity faces Munechika as the jiutai intones "<em
      >The appointed time for forging is known</em
    >", pressing him to get started with his task.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this point on, the shite performs a sequence of <em>kata</em> that
    brings him to Square 1, where he concludes the <em>shōdan</em> with the
    standard sequence:
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>.
