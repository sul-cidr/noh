    <p>The exit of the actors and musicians happens in silence. The shite is the first one to exit, followed by the waki. If a <em>tsukurimono</em> was used in the play, the stage assistants would then procede with its removal.
    In all cases, it is once the actor or stage assistant has passed the Second pine that the curtain is lifted, and pulled back down once he has entered the anteroom.
    From this point, the musicians exit in the same order they entered, nokhan player first, followed by the kotsuzumi, ōtsuzumi,and taiko players. Upon reaching the Second pine, the curtain is pulled back partially on one side.
    As for the jiutai members, they exit through the back left side door starting with the back row members.
    Even as they are exiting the stage, actors, assistants and musicians exhibit great modesty and decorum. Thus, the audience holds its applause until the last musician is about exit.
