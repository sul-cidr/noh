      Munechika acknowledges the encouragement he has drawn from hearing about
      the legendary Chinese and Japanese swords. He asks the young boy to reveal
      his identity but is told instead to pray, prepare for the forging, and
      wait.

    The shōdan marks a sharp return to one of the simplest textures: recitation
    of prose accompanied by the percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic
    setting.

  <p>
    The two protagonists return to their respective kneeling positions in
    Squares 9 and 6 and face each other. Although the swordsmith tries one last
    time to inquire about the boy’s identity, the latter brushes aside the
    question and tells Munechika to get his forge ready. Then, raising on a knee
    and switching to chanting, thus producing a
    <time datetime="00:29:57.000" title="00:29:57">commanding tone</time>, he
    dramatically tells Munchika to expect his return.
