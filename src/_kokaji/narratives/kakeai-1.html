  <p>The shōdan marks a sharp return to one of the simplest textures: recitation of prose accompanied by the percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting. </p>

  <p>The two protagonists return to their respective kneeling positions in Squares 9 and 6 and face each other. Although the swordsmith tries one last time to inquire about the boy’s identity, the latter brushes aside the question and tells Munechika to get his forge ready. Then, raising on a knee and switching to chanting, thus producing a <time datetime='00:29:57.000' title='00:29:57'>commanding tone</time>, he dramatically tells Munchika to expect his return. </p>
