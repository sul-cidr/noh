      The
      <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a>
      is brought in by two stage assistants and placed on
      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 4</a>. It is a
      kind of dais decorated with ropes and paper offerings that represents
      Munechika's forge. Shortly after, the curtain is lifted and the swordsmith
      walks-in in silence. He enters the stage, stops for a moment on Square 2
      facing the audience, turns slightly toward the dais as if acknowledging
      its presence and then, turns further away to walk to Square 8. There, he
      kneels down facing diagonally away from the audience making himself
      absent. He awaits the second act to begin.
