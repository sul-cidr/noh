  <p>The Intermedia Index drops significantly. Musically the <em>kakeai-2</em> is like a moment of respite before the play's dynamic conclusion. Thus, for the span of three <em>honji</em>, there is a substantial reduction of density in the musical textture with the absence of the nohkan, taiko, and jiutai. Moreover, the text, which is factual, is spoken by the shite and waki, rather than sung. Finally, the strict rhythmic synchronization of the chant and its accompaniment found in the preceding five <em>shōdan</em> is temporarily interrupted, as it will return in the next and last <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kiri</em>.</p>

One hears and sees the two performers completing the forging of the blade by engraving their respective <time datetime='00:56:17.000' title='00:56:17'> signature</time>.</p>
