      The action begins with the wakizure standing at the First Pine and the
      waki kneeling and bowing at Third Pine. It is followed by the first
      expansion onto the stage-space proper with the two performers walking to
      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 5 and 9</a>,
      respectively.

    The third <em>shōdan</em> of the Waki Enters <em>dan</em> is its high-point.
    It corresponds to a sudden and substantial expansion of the musical texture,
    with the first entrance of the jiutai, the two hand-percussion instruments
    and the nohkan. It is also characterized by an increase in the use of
    stage-space, with both actors moving from the bridge to the main stage. The
    <em>shōdan</em> also differs from the preceding two with its text setting.
    Up to this point, the text delivered in a spoken fashion, introduced factual
    information, but for the span of this <em>ageuta</em> the focus switches to
    the Munechika’s inner feelings expressed in sung poetry set in
    <em>hiranori</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of Kokaji’s chants are sung in the strong
    <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a>
    style, except for its two <em>ageuta</em>. They both carry Munechika’s
    expression of hesitation and self-doubt, and are sung in the more lyrical
    <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin" target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a> style.
  </p>

  <p>
    Typically, the first line of text of an <em>ageuta</em> is repeated. Here,
    the line is first delivered by Munechika and repeated by the jiutai, who
    thus becomes Munechika's voice, sharing his inner feelings with the
    audience. As it is standard, the initial line and its repetition are
    separated by an
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >, joined in this case by the nohkan
    <a href="/music/nohkan/takane" target="_blank"><em>takane</em></a> pattern.
    It energizes the music and carries the melodic line that follows the
    repetition into the higher range, where the corresponding words end up
    emphasized. In the case of this <em>ageuta</em>, the high range is reached
    over the words
    <em><time datetime="00:09:26.000" title="00:09:26">shintai</time></em
    >, which could be translated as “must decide”, showing Munechika to be under
    tremendous pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The entrance of the next nohkan pattern, the
    <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >
    anticipates a shift in text setting that reflects Munechika's changing
    mindset. The declamatory
    <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a
    >
    used in the first part to express Munechika's self-doubting feeling, is
    replaced with the rhytmical
    <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"
      ><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a
    >, a change that could suggest that he has
    <time datetime="00:10:30.000" title="00:10:20"> faith in divine help</time>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>ageuta</em> corresponds also with the first expansion of the use of
    stage space. Up to this point, it had been limited to the Bridge and Square
    1, but as the jiutai carries the chant, both characters walk from the bridge
    to the stage. Closer to the beginning of the <em>shōdan’s</em> second part,
    the envoy kneels at
    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, the
    traditional position for a secondary actor, while Munechika stops
    center-stage at Square 9, turns and kneels facing the audience. By occupying
    the strong central position, which is usually reserved to the shite, we can
    surmise that Munechika’s role is of greater importance than most waki's.
