<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">
<p> The <em>maibataraki</em> has the highest Intermedia Index in the play. It is a very fast and energetic dance accompanied by congruent nohkan with all percussion instruments in strict rhythm. Whereas the <em>kuse</em> and <em>kiri</em> are dance-to-text, the <em>maibataraki</em> is an instrumental dance based primarily on abstract <em>kata</em> that are nonetheless quite expressive. The word <em>maibataraki</em> is a combination of <em>mai</em>, which signifies pure dance and <em>hataraki</em>, which refers to mimetic dances from the early days of Noh. In Kokaji’s case, it may be understood as a scene in which the deity descends from heavens and shows off his power before taking part in the forging of the sword. </p>
<p> Musically, the dance  has a three-section structure: <em>kakari, ji,</em> and <em>dan</em>. It is articulated by the nohkan's recurring patterns synchronized to the pulsated background of three percussion instruments. The taiko, uses its distinguishable head pattern <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a> for the beginning and closing of cycles.  The dance structure loosely matches the musical one with the <em>kakari</em> serving as a stamping introduction, <em>ji</em> for opening the stage-space leading to the overtaking of its powerful center and <em>dan</em> serving to offer a formal closure and return toward the back.</p>

<p>Please note that because of great complexity but limited space on the page the percussion score shows only the taiko part.</p>

<h3>Kakari</h3>
<p> The <em>kakari</em>, identified in the score with the abbreviation 'Ka', is two- <em>honji</em> long and matches the introductory stamping of the shite. The word <em>kakari</em> can be translated as ‘taking the time to perform something’ or 'initiating something'. In the case of the <em>maibataraki</em>, it is used to set the dance’s dynamic and upbeat mood. Stamps are customarily performed by the shite at the beginning of a dance, as if calling the listener to attention. The dance opens with a sequence of <a href="/movement/six-stamps/" target="_blank">Six Stamps</a>, each one in phase with one of the percussionists’ strokes. The first one is also in phase with the very first note of the nohkan, which plays in a congruent setting for the second and last time in the play. </p>

<h3>Ji</h3>
<p> The form of this section, identified in the score with the abbreviation 'Ji', is musically lead by the nohkan’s patterns, while spatially, it corresponds to an opening of the stage-space and imposing control over the center. The nohkan introduces its core sequence of  <time datetime='00:53:27.000' title='00:53:27'>three patterns</time> that we labelled in the score: a, b, and c, each one lasting one <em>honji</em>. The sequence is played twice. It opens and closes with distinguishable <em>kashira</em> patterns of the taiko.</p>
<p>Against this temporal framework the shite traverses first the right lateral (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 1 to 3</a>), then the front stage (Square 3 to 5), and finally the left-right transversal (Square 5 to 8). This trajectory does not only open-up the stage-space, it also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. The backstage positions of Squares 1 and 8, being positions of rest, they are often used as starting and closing positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other hand, front-stage positions of Squares 3,4,5 and the center-stage Square 9, offer strength and energy. Therefore, in the sequence the motion Square 1 to 3 builds momentum, Square 3 to 5 maintains it, whereas Square 5 to 8 releases tension. It is interesting to note that the above sequence of expansion of the stage-space in the <em>maibataraki </em> is identical to Hashitomi’s <em>jonomai’s</em> <a href="/hashitomi/#startTime=01:03:21" target="_blank">second section</a>. </p>

<h3>Dan</h3>

<p> The temporal boundaries of this four-<em>honji</em> closing section, identified in the score with the abbreviation 'Cl', are once again clearly articulated by the <em>hayashi</em>. The nohkan initiates it with <time datetime='00:53:50.000' title='00:53:50'>two new</time> one-<em>honji</em> patterns (that we labelled 'd', and 'e' in the score) followed by a return of the pattern ‘a’ and the cadential pattern <a href="/music/nohkan/tomenote" target="_blank"><em>tome</em></a>. The <em>dan’s</em> four <em>honji</em> also coincide with the taiko’s second cycle, with its duration once again deliniated by the <em>kashira</em> patterns. Finally, the taiko’s dropping out in the <em>dan’s</em> first <em>honji </em> creates a sudden change of density that helps distinguish its beginning. </p>

<p> During the <em>dan</em>, the shite occupies center-stage where he performs a <time datetime='00:53:46.000' title='00:53:46'>series of impressive </time> <em>kata</em> that reinforce his image of a powerful being: The sequence starts with Two Large Steps and a <a href="/movement/jumps/" target="_blank">Jump Kneel</a>, followed by a <a href="/ movement/multiple/" target="_blank">Double-Kneel</a>, and a Flip Left Sleeve. This is followed with a <a href="/movement/circlet/" target="_blank">Right Circlet</a> and a Circle back to Square 1, where he performs an <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, a <em>kata</em> often used as a closing gesture. </p>
