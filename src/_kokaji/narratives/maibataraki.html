  <p>
    The <em>maibataraki</em> has the highest Intermedia Index in the play. It is
    a very fast and energetic dance accompanied by congruent nohkan with all
    percussion instruments in strict rhythm. Whereas the <em>kuse</em> and
    <em>kiri</em> are dance-to-text, the <em>maibataraki</em> is an instrumental
    dance based primarily on abstract <em>kata</em> that are nonetheless quite
    expressive. The word <em>maibataraki</em> is a combination of <em>mai</em>,
    which signifies pure dance and <em>hataraki</em>, which refers to mimetic
    dances from the early days of Noh. In Kokaji’s case, it may be understood as
    a scene in which the deity descends from heavens and shows off his power
    before taking part in the forging of the sword.
  </p>
  <p>
    Musically, the dance has a three-section structure: <em>kakari, ji,</em> and
    <em>dan</em>. It is articulated by the nohkan's recurring patterns
    synchronized to the pulsated background of three percussion instruments. The
    taiko, uses its distinguishable head pattern
    <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a> for the
    beginning and closing of cycles. The dance structure loosely matches the
    musical one with the <em>kakari</em> serving as a stamping introduction,
    <em>ji</em> for opening the stage-space leading to the overtaking of its
    powerful center and <em>dan</em> serving to offer a formal closure and
    return toward the back.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that because of great complexity but limited space on the page
    the percussion score shows only the taiko part.
  </p>

  <h3>Kakari</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>kakari</em>, identified in the score with the abbreviation 'Ka', is
    two- <em>honji</em> long and matches the introductory stamping of the shite.
    The word <em>kakari</em> can be translated as ‘taking the time to perform
    something’ or 'initiating something'. In the case of the
    <em>maibataraki</em>, it is used to set the dance’s dynamic and upbeat mood.
    Stamps are customarily performed by the shite at the beginning of a dance,
    as if calling the listener to attention. The dance opens with a sequence of
    <a href="/movement/six-stamps/" target="_blank">Six Stamps</a>, each one in
    phase with one of the percussionists’ strokes. The first one is also in
    phase with the very first note of the nohkan, which plays in a congruent
    setting for the second and last time in the play.
  </p>

  <h3>Ji</h3>
  <p>
    The form of this section, identified in the score with the abbreviation
    'Ji', is musically lead by the nohkan’s patterns, while spatially, it
    corresponds to an opening of the stage-space and imposing control over the
    center. The nohkan introduces its core sequence of
    <time datetime="00:53:27.000" title="00:53:27">three patterns</time> that we
    labelled in the score: a, b, and c, each one lasting one <em>honji</em>. The
    sequence is played twice. It opens and closes with distinguishable
    <em>kashira</em> patterns of the taiko.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against this temporal framework the shite traverses first the right lateral
    (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 1 to 3</a>), then
    the front stage (Square 3 to 5), and finally the left-right transversal
    (Square 5 to 8). This trajectory does not only open-up the stage-space, it
    also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. The backstage positions of
    Squares 1 and 8, being positions of rest, they are often used as starting
    and closing positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other
    hand, front-stage positions of Squares 3,4,5 and the center-stage Square 9,
    offer strength and energy. Therefore, in the sequence the motion Square 1 to
    3 builds momentum, Square 3 to 5 maintains it, whereas Square 5 to 8
    releases tension. It is interesting to note that the above sequence of
    expansion of the stage-space in the <em>maibataraki </em> is identical to
    Hashitomi’s <em>jonomai’s</em>
    <a href="/hashitomi/#startTime=01:03:21" target="_blank">second section</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Dan</h3>

  <p>
    The temporal boundaries of this four-<em>honji</em> closing section,
    identified in the score with the abbreviation 'Cl', are once again clearly
    articulated by the <em>hayashi</em>. The nohkan initiates it with
    <time datetime="00:53:50.000" title="00:53:50">two new</time> one-<em
      >honji</em
    >
    patterns (that we labelled 'd', and 'e' in the score) followed by a return
    of the pattern ‘a’ and the cadential pattern
    <a href="/music/nohkan/tomenote" target="_blank"><em>tome</em></a
    >. The <em>dan’s</em> four <em>honji</em> also coincide with the taiko’s
    second cycle, with its duration once again deliniated by the
    <em>kashira</em> patterns. Finally, the taiko’s dropping out in the
    <em>dan’s</em> first <em>honji </em> creates a sudden change of density that
    helps distinguish its beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the <em>dan</em>, the shite occupies center-stage where he performs a
    <time datetime="00:53:46.000" title="00:53:46">series of impressive </time>
    <em>kata</em> that reinforce his image of a powerful being: The sequence
    starts with Two Large Steps and a
    <a href="/movement/jumps/" target="_blank">Jump Kneel</a>, followed by a
    <a href="/ movement/multiple/" target="_blank">Double-Kneel</a>, and a Flip
    Left Sleeve. This is followed with a
    <a href="/movement/circlet/" target="_blank">Right Circlet</a> and a Circle
    back to Square 1, where he performs an
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, a
    <em>kata</em> often used as a closing gesture.
