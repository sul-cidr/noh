      The shite takes over two minutes to exit. When he reaches the Second Pine
      the waki stands up and folows him. After they both have left, the kyōgen
      enters. The curtain is raised for each of them individually.

    The <em>Ageuta 3</em> concluded by the nohkan's shrilling
    <em>hishigi</em> pattern set up an exciting tone for the deity’s vanishing.
    The <em>raijo’s</em> releases that energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its slow and non-congruent first part accompanies the exit of the two
    protagonists, while its congruent second part supports the kyōgen’s
    entrance. The shite is the first one to leave. He is followed by the waki
    who does not enter the bridge
    <time datetime="00:33:08.000" title="00:33:08"
      >until the shite has left</time
    >. The curtian is lifted and closed for the exit of each actor. It is lifted
    one last time for the entrance of the kyōgen actor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The nohkan is the featured instrument. It is accompanied by the three
    percussion instruments whose respective rhythmic patterns merge into a
    single macro-rhythm. Since it is not possible to predict how long the exit
    and entrance will last, musicians follow the <em>mihakarai</em> principle.
    This is a concept of temporal flexibility that allows the number of
    repetitions of a pettern to be determined by the action on stage. In this
    case, it is determined by the time the actors take to exit and enter the
    stage. The taiko player who sits in front of the bridge, introduces on the
    seventh beat a sequence of three
    <a href="/music/taiko/#Strokes" target="_blank"><em>shōnobachi</em></a>
    strokes, and shortens his <em>kakegoe</em>
    <time datetime="00:34:06.000" title="00:34:06">to communicate</time> to the
    other musicians the move to congruency and increase in tempo.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning of the <em>raijo</em>, the shite takes
    <time datetime="00:31:20.000" title="00:31:20">three special footsteps</time
    >, each one performed solemnly, synchronized with the
    <em>kakegoe ‘ho’</em> on beats 2.5 and 6.5. Each step symbolizes the shite
    traveling a long distance at a very fast speed. After the third step, the
    shite walks out in standard fashion.
