  <p>This <em>einori</em> chant marks the beginning of a sequence of three <em>shōdan</em> celebrating the glorious performance of various swords from China and Japan. The decrease in the Intermedia Index is the result of the return to non-congruent singing with both actors remaining nearly motionless almost throughout the <em>shōdan</em>. Yet, the two characters’ close sitting proximity and their <time datetime='00:17:05.000' title='00:17:05'> synchronized kneeling </time> down motion could imply a building of trust. The feeling is further reinforced at the conclusion of the <em>shōdan</em> when <time datetime='00:17:26.000' title='00:17:26'> they turn to face each other</time>.</p>

  <p>The fast and upbeat music featuring the percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a two-pattern non-congruent nohkan part, is well suited for a text that recounts the exploits of two swords: the Chinese Three Foot and Kei swords. The story of the former loosely coinciding the nohkan’s <time datetime='00:16:56.000' title='00:16:56'> first pattern</time>, the story of the latter with its <time datetime='00:17:23.000' title='00:17:23'> second one</time>. From this point on in the play, the light singing mode <em>yowagin</em> is replaced with the heavier <em>tsuyogin</em>, which is commonly used to express bravery and excitement. </p>
