    This <em>einori</em> chant marks the beginning of a sequence of three
    <em>shōdan</em> celebrating the glorious performance of various swords from
    China and Japan. The decrease in the Intermedia Index is the result of the
    return to non-congruent singing with both actors remaining nearly motionless
    almost throughout the <em>shōdan</em>. Yet, the two characters’ close
    sitting proximity and their
    <time datetime="00:17:05.000" title="00:17:05">
      synchronized kneeling
    </time>
    down motion could imply a building of trust. The feeling is further
    reinforced at the conclusion of the <em>shōdan</em> when
    <time datetime="00:17:26.000" title="00:17:26">
      they turn to face each other</time
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fast and upbeat music featuring the percussion instruments in strict
    rhythmic setting and a two-pattern non-congruent nohkan part, is well suited
    for a text that recounts the exploits of two swords: the Chinese Three Foot
    and Kei swords. The story of the former loosely coinciding the nohkan’s
    <time datetime="00:16:56.000" title="00:16:56"> first pattern</time>, the
    story of the latter with its
    <time datetime="00:17:23.000" title="00:17:23"> second one</time>. From this
    point on in the play, the light singing mode <em>yowagin</em> is replaced
    with the heavier <em>tsuyogin</em>, which is commonly used to express
    bravery and excitement.
