  <p>This short two-line dialogue is an introduction to the waki’s monologue, which follows. It includes the envoy’s last line in the play, telling Munechika to move on with forging the requested blade. The swordsmith acquiesces. </p>

  <p>The return to unmetered and unaccompanied prose brings the Intermedia Index back down. The energy of the dialogue is also constrained by the kneeling position and minimal movement of the two actors. Being the first out of three spoken <em>shōdan</em>, the musicians and members of the jiutai put aside their instruments and fans, respectively. Because the waki’s role in Kokaji is substantial and will involve further movement across parts of the stage, it is the wakizure who sits at the waki’s pole (Square 5), where he will remain until the end of the play. Wakizure can be assumed absent from the stage until the final scene when he is briefly needed to accept the sword.</p>
