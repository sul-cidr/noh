    This short two-line dialogue is an introduction to the waki’s monologue,
    which follows. It includes the envoy’s last line in the play, telling
    Munechika to move on with forging the requested blade. The swordsmith
    acquiesces.

    The return to unmetered and unaccompanied prose brings the Intermedia Index
    back down. The energy of the dialogue is also constrained by the kneeling
    position and minimal movement of the two actors. Being the first out of
    three spoken <em>shōdan</em>, the musicians and members of the jiutai put
    aside their instruments and fans, respectively. Because the waki’s role in
    Kokaji is substantial and will involve further movement across parts of the
    stage, it is the wakizure who sits at the waki’s pole (Square 5), where he
    will remain until the end of the play. Wakizure can be assumed absent from
    the stage until the final scene when he is briefly needed to accept the
    sword.
