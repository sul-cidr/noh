    This dialogue, composed of two lines, leads to the waki’s monologue. It
    includes the envoy’s last line in the play, which tells Munechika to forge
    the requested blade. The swordsmith acquiesces.

    The return to unmetered and unaccompanied prose lowers the Intermedia Index.
    The two actors' kneeling position and minimal movement further constrains
    the dialogue's energy. Since this is the first out of three spoken
    <em>shōdan</em>, the musicians and members of the jiutai put aside their
    instruments and fans. Because the waki’s role in Kokaji is substantial and
    will involve further movement across parts of the stage, it is the wakizure
    who sits at the waki’s pole (Square 5), where he will remain until the end
    of the play. From this point on, and until he is briefly needed at the end
    of the play to accept the sword, the wakizure is considered absent and
    invisible.
