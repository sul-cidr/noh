<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <p>
    This <em>shōdan</em> represents the dramatic highlight of the first act, as
    it recounts heroic battles and introduces the play’s first substantial
    dance-to-text section. The poetic text of the <em>hiranori</em> chant is
    sung by the jiutai who speaks for the boy, and the shite whose three
    <em>ageha</em> lines are interspersed within. It is accompanied by the
    percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and three entrances of a
    non-congruent nohkan part. These bring the Intermedia Index almost to the
    highest possible value. The points of intermedia interest are in the use of
    music that helps articulate the narrative’s meaning and structure, and the
    use of mimetic movement that illustrates the narrative while providing a
    gradual formal build-up.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text tells the story of first century Yamato-dake, son of legendary
    Emperor Keikō, and the exploits of his sword <em>Kusanagi no tsurugi</em>.
    Based on the narrative and use of the dance space, the <em>kuse</em> can be
    divided into two parts. An introductory first part during which the shite
    remains kneeling in center stage, and a danced second part that recounts the
    exploits of the <em>Kusanagi no tsurugi</em> illustrated by various mimetic
    <em>kata</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first part develops its narrative through stages, which are deliniated
    by the salient three <em>agehas</em> of the shite and two entrances of the
    nohkan. In the context of the rather static first part small and rare
    movements take particular significance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first lines of text introduce Yamato-dake. Once the action starts and we
    hear about him
    <time datetime="00:21:09.000" title="00:21:09">
      going East to subdue the barbarians</time
    >, the perilous journey is highlighted by the nohkan’s first entrance with
    the
    <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >
    pattern. After we learn that Yamato-dake yearned to come home the music
    slows down and in
    <time datetime="00:22:34.000" title="00:22:34"
      >the first <em>ageha</em> </time
    >he stresses being constantly kept away by battles.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tempo picks up as images of
    <time datetime="00:22:52.000" title="00:22:52">the battlefield</time> with
    gore details are referenced, hightenned by the nohkan’s second entrance and
    the
    <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari" target="_blank"
      ><em>takane mi kusari</em></a
    >
    pattern. As the description is concluding the boy makes his very first move
    as he <time datetime="00:23:46.000" title="00:23:46"> slides left</time> to
    face Munechika, thus reminding all that it is for his sake that this story
    is being told. A slow-down and transitional
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >
    prepare for an introduction to the next battle.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are told that at the time the autumnal colors were fading away. The shite
    who now stands for Yamato-dake slides to the right,
    <a href="/movement/wig/" target="_blank">grabs his forelock</a>, raises on
    his knee, and
    <time datetime="00:24:47.000" title="00:24:47">stares in the distance</time>
    at the fading fall colors. But the circumstances will soon become dire.
    Right after the second <em>ageha</em> in which Yamato-dake recounts being
    <time datetime="00:25:10.000" title="00:25:10"
      >surrounded by barbarians</time
    >
    we learn that the enemies set the grass around him on fire. His
    <time datetime="00:25:12.000" title="00:25:12"
      >Right-Left-Right Head motion
    </time>
    shows him assessing the danger. The intensity of the moment is underscored
    by the nohkan’s
    <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a
    >
    pattern, its last entrance. A moment later, his
    <time datetime="00:25:45.000" title="00:25:45">Downward Head motion</time>,
    as the jiutai refers to the “<em>enemies’ beating war drums</em>” suggests
    that the warrior is considering his options. Finally, as the jiutai refers
    to “<em>…the towering flames as the attack blazed forward.</em>" Yamato-dake
    who is about to drew his sword, is assessing the situation for the last time
    as he
    <time datetime="00:25:53.000" title="00:25:53">
      half rises on his knee</time
    >
    and faces front, then right.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>kuse’s</em> second part showcases Yamato-dake’s sword prowess.
    Helped by the kotsuzumi's patterns which incorporate up-beat strokes, the
    overall tempo of this part is faster than the preceding one and the mimetic
    dance is activated to its fullest.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the shite sings that “the<em
      ><time datetime="00:26:10.000" title="00:26:10">
        Prince drew his sword
      </time></em
    >”, he uses his fan as a sword that he points straight in front of him. He
    then stands up and takes four steps towards the strong Square 4, and
    performs two standard <em>kata</em> often used at the beginning of a dance:
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>. He
    continues to use his fan as a sword
    <time datetime="00:26:44.000" title="00:26:44">
      lashing it left and right
    </time>
    over the words “As it mowed down the grasses in all directions”.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he performs a sequence of Four Stamps, he Opens the Fan, thus marking the
    start of the dance’s high point. He takes a series of steps that bring him
    from front to back-stage (Square 8), temporarily
    <time datetime="00:26:50.000" title="00:26:50"> relaxing the tension</time>.
    From this point on, the shite starts rebuilding momentum by performing a
    <a href="/movement/scooping-point/" target="_blank">Scooping Point</a> that
    carries him back to the strong Square 4 where he performs a
    <a href="/movement/circlet/" target="_blank">Right Circlet</a> to mimic the
    words
    <em
      >“<time datetime="00:27:11.000" title="00:27:11"
        >The blaze lit up the heavens, covered the earth! </time
      >”</em
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon hearing the words “<em
      ><time datetime="00:27:15.000" title="00:27:15"
        >A furnace of fierce flames, turned back to devour the enemy
        forces</time
      ></em
    >”, he moves to the very strong Square 3, glances Left-Right-Left-Right-Down
    at the enemy and uses his fan as if aiming the flames towards the
    barbarians, with a Pointing to the Right as he is
    <a href="/movement/take-the-corner/" target="_blank">Taking the Corner</a>.
    Then, he starts a Large Circle to the Left, but stops on Square 5 to perform
    a Scooping point followed by a Single Right Stamp that marks
    <time datetime="00:27:26.000" title="00:27:26"
      >a sudden slowdown in the tempo</time
    >, that announces the dance’s imminent conclusion. It is over the words “<em
      >So in later years</em
    >”, that the speed drops, suggesting that the narration of Yamato-dake’s
    exploits is over. On his way back to Square 8, the shite Closes his Fan
    confirming that the dance is coming to an end, and upon reaching his
    destination, he concludes the dance commemorating Yamato-dake’s exploits
    with the standard sequence of Scooping Point, and an Open-retreat.
  </p>

  <p>
    The words “<em
      ><time datetime="00:28:05.000" title="00:28:05">And now…</time></em
    >” confirms that the narration of Yamato-dake’s story is indeed over and
    that we are returning to the present, hence it is the words of the young boy
    that the jiutai directs at Munechika. As the jiutai intones “<em
      >And now, this auspiciously omened blade that you must forge! </em
    >”, the tempo gradually increases to underline the urgency of the task
    ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the boy turns towards Munechika and
    <time datetime="00:28:10.000" title="00:28:10"
      >takes one step towards him</time
    >
    but as if feeling that he must stress his point again and more strongly, he
    turns back and goes to Square 1. After pivoting to face Munechika, he
    performs a Scooping Point and while pointing with the fan in an insisting
    fashion he Takes Six Steps towards the swordsmith just as the jiutai sings
    “<em
      >Munechika, heir to a house of proud tradition, set your heart at rest and
      go home now!</em
    >
    ”. The tempo having gradually slowed down to its lowest, the boy standing
    center-stage, concludes the <em>kuse</em> with an Open-retreat and Kneels.
    He finishes the <em>shōdan</em> at the same place and same position as he
    started.
