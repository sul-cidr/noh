  <p>This <em>shōdan</em>, the highlight of the Shite exits <em>dan</em>, substantially raises its Intermedia Index. It marks a return to poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. It also includes a short but dynamic dance.  </p>

  <p>The <em>ageuta</em> opens with the very dynamic <em>kakegoe ‘iya’</em>, which establishes an energetic tone that is maintained throughout the <em>shōdan</em>. Set in a fast tempo, the chant’s eight <em>honji</em> are all sung in the rhythmic <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a> style. The performed <em>kata</em>  are all formal but the text and context provide them with meaning. As we hear the jiutai speaking for the boy, saying that "<em>I will come without fail, at the appointed time</em>" the boy stands up and facing Munechika performs a <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> followed by an <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, two standard <em>kata</em>  that visually <time datetime='00:30:22.000' title='00:30:22'>reinforce his commitment</time>. The swordsmith replies by ceremoniously bowing. </p>

  <p>Then, as the jiutai refers to the clouds of Mount Inari where the boy is about to vanish, <time datetime='00:30:46.000' title='00:30:46'>the tempo suddenly picks up</time>. In preparation for his imminent departure into the sky, the boy builds tension by moving to the very dynamic Square 3, where he circles and faces the waki. Then he releases the tension by going to Square 1 where he performs a <a href="/movement/circlet-point/" target="_blank">Circlet Point</a>. It symbolizes his disappearance witnessed by Munechika who turns right, raises on his knee and points forward in the distance where, the young boy has disappeared.</p>
