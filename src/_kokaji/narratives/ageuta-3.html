    This <em>shōdan</em>, the highlight of the Shite exits <em>dan</em>,
    substantially raises its Intermedia Index. It marks a return to poetic text
    set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the percussion instruments in strict
    rhythmic setting. It also includes a short but dynamic dance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>ageuta</em> opens with the very dynamic <em>kakegoe ‘iya’</em>,
    which establishes an energetic tone that is maintained throughout the
    <em>shōdan</em>. Set in a fast tempo, the chant’s eight <em>honji</em> are
    all sung in the rhythmic
    <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"
      ><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a
    >
    style. The performed <em>kata</em> are all formal but the text and context
    provide them with meaning. As we hear the jiutai speaking for the boy,
    saying that "<em>I will come without fail, at the appointed time</em>" the
    boy stands up and facing Munechika performs a
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>
    followed by an
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, two
    standard <em>kata</em> that visually
    <time datetime="00:30:22.000" title="00:30:22"
      >reinforce his commitment</time
    >. The swordsmith replies by ceremoniously bowing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, as the jiutai refers to the clouds of Mount Inari where the boy is
    about to vanish,
    <time datetime="00:30:46.000" title="00:30:46"
      >the tempo suddenly picks up</time
    >. In preparation for his imminent departure into the sky, the boy builds
    tension by moving to the very dynamic Square 3, where he circles and faces
    the waki. Then he releases the tension by going to Square 1 where he
    performs a
    <a href="/movement/circlet-point/" target="_blank">Circlet Point</a>. It
    symbolizes his disappearance witnessed by Munechika who turns right, raises
    on his knee and points forward in the distance where, the young boy has
    disappeared.
