    This extremely dynamic entrance music announces the arrival of a powerful
    character, in Kokaji’s case, a deity. The <em>hayafue</em> features a
    congruent nohkan part accompanied by the three percussion instruments in
    strict rhythmic setting. This is the first <em>shōdan</em> in the second act
    with the full <em>hayashi</em>. The Intermedia Index has risen again and the
    <em>shōdan</em> continues on the trajectory of increasing energy.

    The melody begins with a brief and striking introduction. It is in a fast
    tempo and starts with the nohkan’s shrilling highest
    <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi" target="_blank"><em>hishigi</em></a> tone.
    It is followed by a 7-<em>honji</em>-long melody that is played two times
    and a half. At the very end of its second iteration the curtain is lifted,
    and shite makes his fast and energetic
    <time datetime="00:52:01.000" title="00:52:01">entrance</time> onto the
    bridge. His left arm is stretched forward holding a hammer. He delays
    entering the stage proper however as he first turns to face the audience,
    and then performs the standard sequence of <em>kata</em>:
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a> at the
    First pine. It is there that he stands at the conclusion of the
    <em>hayafue</em>, still holding the left arm stretched building anticipation
    that will be resolved at the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, when he
    finally enters the stage proper.
