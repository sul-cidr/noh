  <p>Although the Intermedia Index of this spoken dialogue is low, it has an interesting intermedia quality that comes from the combination of the use of stage space and text setting. </p>

  <p>Kokaji’s first act does not have a Shite enters <em>dan</em> because his appearance is intended to be a surprise, an effect that would have been spoiled with an entrance music. Thus, the <em>shōdan</em> opens with the shite's first line of a dialogue. It comes as a call from the distance called <em>yobikake</em>, heard as the shite is still out of sight in the mirror room. The waki standing on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 6</a> facing in his direction, is <time datetime='00:12:53.000' title='00:12:53'>mesmerized</time>, as he wonders about the origin of the heard voice. This leads to the entrance of the shite and an exchange between the two protagonists separated by the <time datetime='00:13:09.000' title='00:13:09'>widest possible distance</time> that creates a dramatic effect as if worlds apart.</p>

  <p>As the shite in the role of a young boy finally reaches Square 1 and turns to face Munechika, there is a sudden <time datetime='00:14:46.000' title='00:14:46'>change of tone and style</time> in the delivery of the last two lines of the <em>shōdan</em>. The actors switch to  non-congruent singing to share a sentence of poetic text. The waki starts with a line that summarizes his astonishment : "<em>A voice in heaven</em>". It is followed with the shite’s "<em>echoes on the earth.</em>", which confirms his arrival in Munechika’s world. The switch also serves as a smooth transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>, whose poetic text is also sung. </p>
