    Although the Intermedia Index of this spoken dialogue is low, it has an
    interesting intermedia quality that comes from the combination of the use of
    stage space and text setting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kokaji’s first act does not have a Shite enters <em>dan</em> because his
    appearance is intended to be a surprise, an effect that would have been
    spoiled with an entrance music. Thus, the <em>shōdan</em> opens with the
    shite's first line of a dialogue. It comes as a call from the distance
    called <em>yobikake</em>, heard as the shite is still out of sight in the
    mirror room. The waki standing on
    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 6</a> facing in his
    direction, is
    <time datetime="00:12:53.000" title="00:12:53">mesmerized</time>, as he
    wonders about the origin of the heard voice. This leads to the entrance of
    the shite and an exchange between the two protagonists separated by the
    <time datetime="00:13:09.000" title="00:13:09"
      >widest possible distance</time
    >
    that creates a dramatic effect as if worlds apart.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the shite in the role of a young boy finally reaches Square 1 and turns
    to face Munechika, there is a sudden
    <time datetime="00:14:46.000" title="00:14:46"
      >change of tone and style</time
    >
    in the delivery of the last two lines of the <em>shōdan</em>. The actors
    switch to non-congruent singing to share a sentence of poetic text. The waki
    starts with a line that summarizes his astonishment : "<em
      >A voice in heaven</em
    >". It is followed with the shite’s "<em>echoes on the earth.</em>", which
    confirms his arrival in Munechika’s world. The switch also serves as a
    smooth transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>, whose poetic text is also
    sung.
