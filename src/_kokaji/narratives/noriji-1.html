    The Intermedia Index rises as the music of the <em>noriji 1</em> becomes
    congruent with the poetic text set in <em>ōnori</em> and the accompaniment
    of the three percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. The
    intermedia interest of the <em>noriji 1</em> lies in how it continues to
    raise the energy and creates a transition between the adjacent
    <em>shōdan</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>noriji-1</em> is at first
    <time datetime="00:48:40.000" title="00:48:40"> visually static</time>.
    Munechika kneeling on the
    <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a> remains
    motionless as he announces that he is going to pray. The prayer is delivered
    by the jiutai, an increase of density when compared to the single voice in
    the preceding <em>notto</em>. A moment later Munechika begins to wave a
    sacred wand as the jiutai speaking for him, calls for divine help. The music
    builds momentum with its faster tempo and larger instrumentation that now
    includes the taiko for the first time in Act II.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>noriji 1</em> leads to the <em>hayafue</em>, the entrance music that
    will bring on stage the second-act shite personifying a divine being. The
    profound reverence and intensity of the prayer are artfully produced by
    using text and tempo. Set in <em>ōnori</em>, the poetic text counts in
    average eight syllables per <em>honji</em>. In preparation for the
    swordsmith’s statement of entreaty “<em>hear and grant my prayer</em>”, the
    tempo is substantially slowed down by the taiko pattern switching
    <time datetime="00:50:29.000" title="00:50:29">
      from two to one stroke per beat</time
    >. This leads to the dramatic line “<em
      ><time datetime="00:50:51.000" title="00:50:51">kinjo-saihai</time></em
    >”, which means a prayer. At this point the text setting switches to
    non-congruent and slows down with only three syllables per <em>honji</em>.
    The waki sings the first word, the jiutai the second. Against the slow-down
    in the vocal line, the percussion instruments’ create an accelerando that
    sets the tone for the dynamic <em>hayafue</em> and the entrance of the
    second-act shite.
