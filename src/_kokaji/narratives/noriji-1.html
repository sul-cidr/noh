  <p>The Intermedia Index rises as the music of the <em>noriji 1</em> becomes congruent with the poetic text set in <em>ōnori</em> and the accompaniment of the three percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. The intermedia interest of the <em>noriji 1</em> lies in how it continues to raise the energy and creates a transition between the adjacent <em>shōdan</em>. </p>


  <p>The <em>noriji-1</em> is at first <time datetime='00:48:40.000' title='00:48:40'> visually static</time>. Munechika kneeling on the <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a> remains motionless as he announces that he is going to pray. The prayer is delivered by the jiutai, an increase of density when compared to the single voice in the preceding <em>notto</em>. A moment later Munechika begins to wave a sacred wand as the jiutai speaking for him, calls for divine help. The music builds momentum with its faster tempo and larger instrumentation that now includes the taiko for the first time in Act II. </p>


  <p>The <em>noriji 1</em> leads to the <em>hayafue</em>, the entrance music that will bring on stage the second-act shite personifying a divine being. The profound reverence and intensity of the prayer are artfully produced by using text and tempo. Set in <em>ōnori</em>, the poetic text counts in average eight syllables per <em>honji</em>. In preparation for the swordsmith’s statement of entreaty “<em>hear and grant my prayer</em>”, the tempo is substantially slowed down by the taiko pattern switching <time datetime='00:50:29.000' title='00:50:29'> from two to one stroke per beat</time>. This leads to the dramatic line “<em><time datetime='00:50:51.000' title='00:50:51'>kinjo-saihai</time></em>”, which means a prayer. At this point the text setting switches to non-congruent and slows down with only three syllables per <em>honji</em>. The waki sings the first word, the jiutai the second. Against the slow-down in the vocal line, the percussion instruments’ create an accelerando that sets the tone for the dynamic <em>hayafue</em> and the entrance of the second-act shite. </p>
