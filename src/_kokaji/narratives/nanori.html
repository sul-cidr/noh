        <div class="section-introduction__definition">An envoy from Emperor Ichijo introduces himself as Tachibana no Michinari. He is traveling to inform the swordsmith Munechika of an imperial order requesting that he forges a blade that the emperor has seen in a dream oracle.

        <div class="section-introduction__definition">Having walked through the bridge, the wakizure dressed in <a href="/staging/costumes/#Kokaji-Wakizure" target="_blank">courtier’s costume</a> stops at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a> to deliver his lines. The stage may represent the Imperial Palace where the envoy starts his journey or somewhere on the way to Kyoto where Munechika lives. His walking back onto the bridge stopping at the First Pine suggests that he has traveled and finally arrived at his destination. </div>

<p>The envoy's <time datetime='00:03:06.000' title='00:03:06'>unaccompanied entrance</time> is followed by his self-introduction and explanation of intentions, done at the quiet <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a> in a simplest way as an unmetered, unaccompanied prose. Thus, the <em>shōdan’s</em> Intermedia Index is the play’s lowest, as it is commonly the case for a play’s first <em>shōdan</em>. </p>

  <p>The envoy concludes the <em>nanori</em> by bringing his <time datetime='00:04:50.000' title='00:04:50'> hands together</time>, holding a fan in his right one. While the origin of the gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture used by secular and religious characters alike, such as the <a href="/hashitomi/nanori/#startTime=00:06:25" target="_blank">monk</a> in Hashitomi.</p>
