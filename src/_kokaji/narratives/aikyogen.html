      A deity from a subsidiary shrine summarizes the events from the first act,
      gives additional accounts of famous swords, and expresses confidence in
      the power of prayer and consequently Munechika's ability to complete the

    The kyōgen in Kokaji starts with the actor's entrance over the continuing
    music of <em>raijo</em>. This, and the fact that the actor wears a mask is
    somewhat rare and is dictated by the fact that the character is a diety. The
    intermedia character of the interlude is simple, as it is usually the case.
    The actor recites his text with very little movement and without music.

  <p>
    Often during the interlude, also called the <em>nakairi</em>, the kyōgen
    actor engages in a discussion with the waki. In such instances, he kneels
    center stage conversing with the waki kneeling at
    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, as it is the
    case with Hashitomi’s
    <a href="/hashitomi/aikyogen/" target="_blank"><em>aikyōgen</em></a
    >. But in Kokaji, the waki has exited the stage with the shite for a change
    of costume, thus the actor addresses the audience with a monologue standing
    on Square 1. Like the members of the jiutai, the four musicians have their
    hands in their pockets to show that although on stage, they are not part of
    the action.
