  <p>The kyōgen in Kokaji starts with the actor's entrance over the continuing music of <em>raijo</em>. This, and the fact that the actor wears a mask is somewhat rare and is dictated by the fact that the character is a diety. The intermedia character of the interlude is simple, as it is usually the case. The actor recites his text with very little movement and without music.</p>

<p>Often during the interlude, also called the <em>nakairi</em>, the kyōgen actor engages in a discussion with the waki. In such instances, he kneels center stage conversing with the waki kneeling at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, as it is the case with Hashitomi’s <a href="/hashitomi/aikyogen/" target="_blank"><em>aikyōgen</em></a>. But in Kokaji, the waki has exited the stage with the shite for a change of costume, thus the actor addresses the audience with a monologue standing on Square 1. Like the members of the jiutai, the four musicians have their hands in their pockets to show that although on stage, they are not part of the action.
