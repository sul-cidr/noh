    The first act opens right away in the medium range of the Intermedia Index.
    It feels as if the drama picks up where it left off at the end of the first
    act, and continues on a steady course of increasing activity even within the
    <em>shōdan</em> itself. All of the instruments are playing from the
    beginning, some with a regularity of pulse. The waki first joins by
    performing mimetic movements, before starting to sing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>notto</em> begins with a lively musical introduction. The percussion
    parts are in strict rhythmic setting. The kotsuzumi player sets the tone by
    playing the steady <em>notto uchitsume</em> pattern characterized by a
    stroke on each of the <em>honji’s</em> eight beats. Both the kotsuzumi
    pattern and the non-congruent nohkan’s part are exclusively used in the
    <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-music" target="_blank"
      ><em>notto</em>-music</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Munechika has been waiting in a kneeling position at Square 8, facing
    diagonally away from the audience, as if absent. About half-way into the
    introduction music, he stands up and walks towards the
    <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a>
    representing his forge, steps on it and kneels. Picking up a sacred wand
    with the right hand, he performs a purifying ritual. The text of the
    <em>notto</em>-chant, set in<em>sashinori</em> is loosely synchornized with
    the accompaniment by fitting its lines between the
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-sounds" target="_blank"><em>chon</em></a> strokes
    of the ōtsuzumi. These fall on <em>honji’s</em>
    <time datetime="00:45:56.000" title="00:45:56">third beat</time> and are
    preceded by a slight slowdown and an extended kakegoe. Longer lines that do
    not fit within the eight-beat span of the successive <em>chon</em> strokes,
    are spread over three or four <em>honji</em>. In this case, there is no
    rallentando leading to the intermediate <em>chon</em> stroke(s), and during
    the intermediate <em>honji</em> the ōtsuzumi performs a sequence of four,
    five, or six <em>chon</em> strokes
    <time datetime="00:47:23.000" title="00:47:23">
      that maintain the momentum</time
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    From time to time the chant slows down to emphasize selected words. This
    happens for instance, when Munechika acknowledges that his craft came to him
    through
    <time datetime="00:47:08.000" title="00:47:08"> no effort of his own</time>
    with the line ‘<em>chikara ni arazu</em>. The emphasis can also be done by a
    combination of rhythm and pitch. When Munechika raises the wand and prays
    for divine assistance in the completion his task, the line lasts three
    <em>honji</em> and its syllables are spread to create a rallentando on the
    words: “<time datetime="00:46:29.000" title="00:46:29"
      >...I make my petition</time
    >”. The stress on the keyword ‘<em>sasage</em>’ is emphasized when Munechika
    interrupts his steady tone with a raising of pitch followed by a descending
    glissando. In this case, the effect could be perceived as an expression of
    commitment toward the fulfillment of the imperial order.
