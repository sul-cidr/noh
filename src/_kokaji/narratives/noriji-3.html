    Although the Intermedia Index drops slightly as the nohkan is not involved
    in the <em>shōdan</em>, it remains very high due to the richness of movement
    and congruency of the music. The shite and jiutai alternate as narrators
    describing the strongly mimetic action of sword forging witnessed by the
    audience. Text and <em>kata</em> are in perfect synchrony, where what is
    said is what is seen. The text even involves words of onomatopea to
    strengthen the 'realistic' quality of the scene.

    The <em>noriji-3</em> can be divided into three segments, each beginning the
    taiko's head pattern
    <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a
    >. In the first section we are told that the deity is a young boy who
    ascends the forge mound before bowing to the waki. During the next segment,
    the deity asks Munechika to
    <time datetime="00:54:58.000" title="00:54:58">bring the metal</time> to be
    forged into a blade. He obliges and as they proceed with their work by
    alternating hammering, the sound of the hit metal is imitated with the
    onomatopea: ‘chō’. Finally, the text highlights the magnificence of the
    event. As the jiutai narrates that the
    <time datetime="00:55:54.000" title="00:55:55"
      >strokes are heard through heaven and earth</time
    >, the shite jumps out of the dais covers his head with his sleeves to
    indicate that he temporarily disappears from the location. His
    Up-Left-Right-Down Head motion suggests however that he can hear the sound
    of the strokes bouncing off through space. This is followed by the waki’s
    Left-Right Head motion which confirms that he can also hear it .
