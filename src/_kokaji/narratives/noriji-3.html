  <p>Although the Intermedia Index drops slightly as the nohkan is not involved in the <em>shōdan</em>, it remains very high due to the richness of movement and congruency of the music. The shite and jiutai alternate as narrators describing the strongly mimetic action of sword forging witnessed by the audience. Text and <em>kata</em> are in perfect synchrony, where what is said is what is seen. The text even involves words of onomatopea to strengthen the 'realistic' quality of the scene. </p>

  <p>The <em>noriji-3</em> can be divided into three segments, each beginning the taiko's head pattern <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a>. In the first section we are told that the deity is a young boy who ascends the forge mound before bowing to the waki. During the next segment, the deity asks Munechika to <time datetime='00:54:58.000' title='00:54:58'>bring the metal</time> to be forged into a blade. He obliges and as they proceed with their work by alternating hammering, the sound of the hit metal is imitated with the onomatopea: ‘chō’. Finally, the text highlights the magnificence of the event. As the jiutai narrates that the <time datetime='00:55:54.000' title='00:55:55'>strokes are heard through heaven and earth</time>, the shite jumps out of the dais covers his head with his sleeves to indicate that he temporarily disappears from the location. His Up-Left-Right-Down Head motion suggests however that he can hear the sound of the strokes bouncing off through space. This is followed by the waki’s Left-Right Head motion which confirms that he can also hear it . </p>
