      The Imperial envoy arrives at swordsmith Munechika’s house, where he
      delivers the sovereign's order to forge him a blade. Munechika replies
      that he cannot accomplish it without an appropriately skilled assistant
      but is told to comply.

      The action takes place on the stage's bridge, which represents the
      entrance to Munechika’s house. The wakizure (imperial envoy) standing at
      the First Pine calls for Munechika. The curtain is raised, the waki
      (Munechika) dressed in
      <a href="/staging/costumes/#Kokaji-Waki1" target="_blank"
        >"street clothes" of a samurai</a
      >, walks in. He stops at the Third Pine, kneels and bows to the wakizure.
      They remain in their positions throughout the ensuing dialogue.

    With the introduction of a second actor the overall dramatic intensity
    increases but only slightly since the action is not taking place on the main
    stage but on the bridge. The swordsmith Munechika greets the imperial envoy
    with a <time datetime="00:05:41.000" title="00:05:41">customary bow</time>.
    What ensues is an unmetered, unaccompanied dialogue in prose that keeps the
    Intermedia Index in the very low range.

    Upon hearing that he is to forge a sword for the Emperor, Munechika who is
    doubting his abilities, tries to find a way to decline the request. The
    envoy getting impatient, delivers his last line: “<em
      >Let me repeat the imperial command</em
    >”, with a forceful style of singing called
    <em><time datetime="00:08:32.000" title="00:08:32">suteru</time></em
    >, stressing his order with a commanding step towards the swordsmith.
