        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The action takes place on the stage's bridge, which represents the entrance to Munechika’s house. The wakizure (imperial envoy) standing at the First Pine calls for Munechika. The curtain is raised, the waki (Munechika) dressed in <a href="/staging/costumes/#Kokaji-Waki1" target="_blank">"street clothes" of a samurai</a>, walks in. He stops at the Third Pine, kneels and bows to the wakizure. They remain in their positions throughout the ensuing dialogue.</div>

  <p>With the introduction of a second actor the overall dramatic intensity increases but only slightly since the action is not taking place on the main stage but on the bridge. The swordsmith Munechika greets the imperial envoy with a <time datetime='00:05:41.000' title='00:05:41'>customary bow</time>. What ensues is an unmetered, unaccompanied dialogue in prose that keeps the Intermedia Index in the very low range. </p>

  <p>Upon hearing that he is to forge a sword for the Emperor, Munechika who is doubting his abilities, tries to find a way to decline the request. The envoy getting impatient, delivers his last line: “<em>Let me repeat the imperial command</em>”, with a forceful style of singing called <em><time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>suteru</time></em>, stressing his order with a commanding step towards the swordsmith. </p>
