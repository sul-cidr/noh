  <p>
    Although the shite joins the jiutai in singing, the Intermedia Index is
    lowered because the chant is in non-congruent <em>sashinori</em>, the
    percussion instruments switch back to flexible setting and nohkan part is
    non-congruent. The decrease has also to do with the absence of any stage
    movement as the two protagonists remain motionless, almost until the end of
    the <em>shōdan</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text narrates the story of another ancient Chinese sword, and while the
    shite and jiutai alternate in singing, this is not a dialogue since the
    jiutai simply carries on the boy’s words. While the text of the next
    <em>shōdan</em> will focus on a legendary Japanese sword, the
    <em>sashi’s</em> text concludes the narration of stories related to Chinese
    swords started in the preceding <em>kuri</em>. The <em>shōdan</em> closes
    with an uptick of energy when the nohkan enters with the
    <em>kuse no ryō</em> pattern over the line “<em
      ><time datetime="00:19:09.000" title="00:19:09"
        >and their miraculous power is beyond expression!
      </time></em
    >”, as the shite turns to make eye contact with the waki.
