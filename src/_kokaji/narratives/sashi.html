  <p>Although the shite joins the jiutai in singing, the Intermedia Index is lowered because the chant is in non-congruent <em>sashinori</em>, the percussion instruments switch back to flexible setting and nohkan part is non-congruent. The decrease has also to do with the absence of any stage movement as the two protagonists remain motionless, almost until the end of the <em>shōdan</em>.</p>

  <p>The text narrates the story of another ancient Chinese sword, and while the shite and jiutai alternate in singing, this is not a dialogue since the jiutai simply carries on the boy’s words. While the text of the next <em>shōdan</em> will focus on a legendary Japanese sword, the <em>sashi’s</em> text concludes the narration of stories related to Chinese swords started in the preceding <em>kuri</em>. The <em>shōdan</em> closes with an uptick of energy when the nohkan enters with the <em>kuse no ryō</em> pattern over the line  “<em><time datetime='00:19:09.000' title='00:19:09'>and their miraculous power is beyond expression! </time></em>”, as the shite turns to make eye contact with the waki. </p>
