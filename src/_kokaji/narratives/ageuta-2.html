    The Dialogue <em>dan</em> is concluded with a congruent chant that
    substantially increases the Intermedia Index. It is delivered by the jiutai,
    who speaks for the young boy. The poetic text set in
    <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by percussion set in strict rhythm and a
    non-congruent nohkan's part, carries the boy’s words of encouragements for
    Munechika. The dramatic expression is very much heightened by the use of
    formal <em>kata</em> that align well with the musical changes but not at all
    with the boy’s words. Against his encouraging words sung by the jiutai, the
    movements performed by the two characters appear to display mistrust and
    psychological tension between them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Munechika is clearly uneasy about meeting an unknown boy who knows much
    about him. He is not reassured when told that
    <em>”Walls have ears: In a world where rocks may speak…”</em>. The distrust
    between the two characters is made clear when they
    <time datetime="00:15:17.000" title="00:15:17">break eye contact</time> and
    turn away from each other. This happens during the
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >
    which separate the <em>ageuta’s</em> initial line from its repetition. The
    powerful <em>kakegoe ‘iya’</em> and the nohkan’s
    <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a
    >
    pattern, energize the music and carry the melodic line that follows the
    repetition into the higher range, where the corresponding words end up
    emphasized. In this case, the emphasized text
    <em><time datetime="00:15:37.000" title="00:15:37">kakure</time></em> which
    means ‘hidden’, maintains the feeling of distrust as shown by the fact that
    the two protagonists continue to keep their distance from one another.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is upon hearing a reference to the
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:16:04.000" title="00:16:04"
        >"radiance of the Emperor’s sword"</time
      ></em
    >
    that the two characters turn towards each another, attempting one more time
    to establish trust. The shite even goes as far as to take three steps
    towards the waki, but the
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:16:12.000" title="00:16:12"
        >effort is in vain</time
      ></em
    >, and understood as failed when the shite turns away from the waki and
    circles to Square 1. The nohkan underlines the tense situation with the
    entrance of the
    <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >
    pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,
    <time datetime="00:16:30.000" title="00:16:30"
      >after rebuilding momentum</time
    >
    with a
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and
    an <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, it is
    over the words <em> “It (the sword) must be realized”</em> that the two
    protagonists once again turn towards each other, and that the shite takes
    One Step towards the waki, suggesting that the communication line between
    the two is now open.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although done in a much subtler fashion, the changes in the music structure
    follow the unfolding narrative. The three attempts at setting up trust
    between the boy and the swordsmith are matched with three changes in the
    delivery mode from the declamatory
