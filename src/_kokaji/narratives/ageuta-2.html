  <p>The Dialogue <em>dan</em> is concluded with a congruent chant that substantially increases the Intermedia Index. It is delivered by the jiutai, who speaks for the young boy. The poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by percussion set in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan's part, carries the boy’s words of encouragements for Munechika. The dramatic expression is very much heightened by the use of formal <em>kata</em> that align well with the musical changes but not at all with the boy’s words. Against his encouraging words sung by the jiutai, the movements performed by the two characters  appear to display mistrust and psychological tension between them. </p>

  <p>Munechika is clearly uneasy about meeting an unknown boy who knows much about him. He is not reassured when told that <em>”Walls have ears: In a world where rocks may speak…”</em>. The distrust between the two characters is made clear when they <time datetime='00:15:17.000' title='00:15:17'>break eye contact</time> and turn away from each other. This happens during the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> which separate the <em>ageuta’s</em> initial line from its repetition. The powerful <em>kakegoe ‘iya’</em> and the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi-takane" target="_blank"><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a> pattern, energize the music and carry the melodic line that follows the repetition into the higher range, where the corresponding words end up emphasized. In this case, the emphasized text <em><time datetime='00:15:37.000' title='00:15:37'>kakure</time></em> which means ‘hidden’, maintains the feeling of distrust as shown by the fact that the two protagonists continue to keep their distance from one another. </p>

  <p>It is upon hearing a reference to the <em><time datetime='00:16:04.000' title='00:16:04'>"radiance of the Emperor’s sword"</time></em> that the two characters turn towards each another, attempting one more time to establish trust. The shite even goes as far as to take three steps towards the waki, but the <em><time datetime='00:16:12.000' title='00:16:12'>effort is in vain</time></em>, and understood as failed when the shite turns away from the waki and circles to Square 1. The nohkan underlines the tense situation with the entrance of the <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"><em>naka no takane</em></a> pattern. </p>

  <p>Finally, <time datetime='00:16:30.000' title='00:16:30'>after rebuilding momentum</time> with a <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and an <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, it is over the words <em> “It (the sword) must be realized”</em> that the two protagonists once again turn towards each other, and that the shite takes One Step towards the waki, suggesting that the communication line between the two is now open. </p>

  <p>Although done in a much subtler fashion, the changes in the music structure follow the unfolding narrative. The three attempts at setting up trust between the boy and the swordsmith are matched with three changes in the delivery mode from the declamatory <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a> used for setting up the attempt, to the rhythmic  <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a> used for the first two unsuccessful consequences and the last propitious one: </p>
