            The spoken sections called <em>kotoba</em> consist of non-rhythmical
            prose intoned with a full voice. Usually, sentences are divided into
            two parts: a gradual rising tone reaching a peak followed by a
            falling off. In the text transcription of the
            /Users/Jarek/noh-website/noh/src/ excerpts the colored syllables are
            used to identify the higher pitches that lead to a descent.

            The chanted music called <em>utai</em> can be sung in two different
            styles: <em>yowagin</em> – a gentler melodic singing and
            <em>tsuyogin</em> – a more forceful and dramatic one.

          refers to the high pitch Kuri, hence the module’s melody is set in the
