        <p>
          The hip drum ōtsuzumi and the shoulder drum kotsuzumi almost always
          play together in alternating or interlocking patterns, and as such,
          they form a sort of meta-instrument. For this reason we are presenting
          them together.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are five ōtsuzumi schools: Ōkura, Kanze, Ishii, Kadono and
          Takayasu. Featured TANIGUCHI Masatoshi and all ōtsuzumi examples are
          from the Ishii tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are four kotsuzumi schools: Ōkura, Kanze, Kō, and Kōsei.
          Featured HAYASHI Yamato and all kotsuzumi examples are from the Kō
          tradition.

          Drummers alternate strokes on the drums with shouts called
          <em>kakegoe</em>. Those most frequently used by ōtsuzumi players are
          <em>yo, ho, iya, yo-i,</em> and <em>hon-yo</em>, whereas the kotsuzumi
          players use <em>yo, ho, and iya</em>.

          Each of these calls can take shape depending on context. They not only
          help set the mood, they are also an important communication tool,
          helping the musicians coordinate acceleration and slow-down. The
          example below is a shorter version of <em>ashirai</em>, played
          expressively for the play Aoi no ue. It illustrates how the two
          percussionists use <em>kakegoe</em> to manage changes of tempo. In the
          video, the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi alternate their calls with drumming
          strokes. Because the ōtsuzumi player initiates patterns, he has a
          leading role in establishing the tempo and mood, but both players
          influence each other in creating a cumulative tempo.

        <h3 id="Rhythm">Rhythmic Organization</h3>

        <h4 id="strictness">Strict and Flexible</h4>
        <p>
          The drum parts are connected to the eight-beat measure. We call a
          rhythmic setting 'strict' when the beat is relatively steady and
          'flexible' when the beat is irregular. In the latter case, the music
          is often characterized by fewer strokes and a slower tempo. The
          difference between the two rhythmic settings is also accentuated by
          the <em>kakegoe</em>. In strict setting, the calls are centered
          between beats and have a shorter, more accented quality. In flexible
          setting, the calls start earlier and can extend for the duration
          between beats. Percussion parts in a flexible rhythmic setting are
          performed primarily by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi since most of the
          music involving the taiko is strict.
        </p>

        <p id="Settings">
          For comparison, an <em>Ashirai</em> sequence of four eight-beat
          measures is performed in a strict and flexible setting.

        <h4 id="patterns">Patterns</h4>
        <p>
          The percussionists’ strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> are arranged into
          patterns of varying duration—as short as two and as long as thirty-two
          beats. Patterns are then sequenced to produce longer phrases. Although
          the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi have their own set of patterns, they
          usually work as a pair. When accompanying singers, their individual
          patterns interlock and complement each other to form a single combined
          eight-beat pattern. The ōtsuzumi, with its louder sound, is usually
          more active within the first four of the eight beats, while the softer
          kotsuzumi picks up in the last four. This creates a continuous
          fluctuation of color and intensity. The combined patterns typically
          start on the upbeat leading to the first beat of the eight-beat unit
          (<em>honji</em>).
        </p>

        <p>
          For both instruments, there are several categories of patterns of
          which we will cover the most prevalent two, ground and closing. The
          majority of ground patterns fall into two different types:
          <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em>.
        </p>

        <h5 id="Mitsuji">Mitsuji</h5>
        <p>
          <em>Mitsuji</em> patterns are characterized by a smaller number of
          strokes and a degree of rhythmic ambiguity that increases the
          dependence on <em>kakegoe</em> to maintain cohesion. They can be
          performed in strict or flexible rhythmic setting as shown in the
          following examples:

        <p>
          <em>Tsuzuke</em> patterns are characterized by a larger number of
          strokes and relative rhythmic stability. The respective patterns of
          the two instruments spread and interlock to cover the entire
          eight-beat unit. They can be performed in a strict or flexible
          rhythmic setting, as shown in the following examples:

        <h5 id="Sequence">Mixed Sequence</h5>
        <p>
          The sequencing of <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns
          creates phrases whose rhythm moves like waves: from rhythmic ambiguity
          created by the sporadic attacks of the <em>mitsuji</em> pattern, to
          rhythmic clarity coming from the steadier <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns,
          and back to ambiguity with the beginning of the next phrase’s
          <em>mitsuji</em> patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this context, five observations can be made:<br />
          1. The two percussion instruments have a large selection of
          <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns (well beyond the few
          provided examples). In our narrative, we have used these terms
          broadly: <em>mitsuji</em> for an eight-beat measure (<em>honji</em>)
          articulated with a limited number of strokes, and <em>tsuzuke</em> for
          a <em>honji</em> articulated typically with one stroke per beat.<br />
          2. Rhythmic phrases always begin with a <em>mitsuji</em> pattern
          leading to a <em>tsuzuke</em>, which either leads to a cadential
          pattern or to another phrase: <em>mitsuji</em> –
          <em>tsuzuke</em> sequence.<br />
          3. The ratio of <em>mitsuji</em> to <em>tsuzuke</em> in a phrase
          affects its overall rhythmic stability. Phrases with more
          <em>mitsuji</em> patterns have a higher degree of rhythmic ambiguity,
          while phrases with more <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns have a higher degree
          of rhythmic stability.<br />
          4. The degree of rhythmic stability/ambiguity of a phrase is also
          impacted by its rhythmic setting, where a strict setting is more
          stable than a flexible one. <br />
          5. The sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns are most often used to
          accompany a chant set in the declamatory
          <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"
            ><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a
          >. The limited number of percussion strokes is counter-balanced by the
          melodic line unfolding with few or no rests. On the other hand, the
          regular <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns are most often used to accompany a
          chant set in the
          <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"
            ><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a
          >, where syllables held over to accommodate the measure’s eight beats
          create rest in the melodic line counter-balanced by the steady
          percussion strokes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following two videos show strict and flexible setting of a mixed
          sequence. Each version begins with four repetitions of a
          <em>mitsuji</em> pattern followed by one <em>tsuzuke</em>.

        <h5 id="Uchikiri">Uchikiri pattern</h5>
        <p>
          <em>Uchikiri</em> pattern is often used as a bridge to reestablish a
          strict rhythmic setting after a flexible module (<em>shōdan</em>) or
          after a very slow, strict one. It often leads to <em>shōdan</em> with
          a strict rhythmic setting such as <em>Ageuta</em>, <em>Kuse</em>, or
          <em>Sageuta</em>. It is easily recognizable by the ōtsuzumi player’s
          <em>kakegoe</em> <em>"ha hon yo"</em>. In this video, the excerpt is
          extended to include the first beat of the following phrase.
        </p>
        {% include video-no-background.html

        <h5 id="Entrance">Entrance and Dance music</h5>
        <p>
          When performing dances, <em>Noriji</em>, and some entrance music, the
          musicians maintain complementarity between the two hand drums despite
          the fact that they perform patterns of different length. This is
          demonstrated in the following excerpts from the dance
          <em>Jonomai</em>. In this example the kotsuzumi’s
          <em>nagaji</em> pattern is spread over sixteen-beats against the
          ōtsuzumi's <em>ji</em> pattern that lasts eight-beat.
        </p>
        <p>Kotsuzumi's <em>nagaji</em> sixteen-beat pattern:</p>
        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/Kotsuzumi-Nagaji.png" %}

        <p>Ōtsuzumi's <em>ji</em> eight-beat pattern:</p>
        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Otsuzumi-Ji.png"
        %}

        <p>
          Another noteworthy point is how the ōtsuzumi's closing
          (<em>shikake</em>) pattern breaks the predictability of the repeated
          patterns. Its steady six strokes and subsequent
          <em>kakegoe</em> announce the end of the dance and initiate a
          cadential deccelerando.
