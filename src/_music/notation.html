        <h2 id="Props">Notation</h2>
        <p>
          Although chant, dance, and music are transmitted aurally and orally
          from teacher to student, notation has had an important role in
          supporting the accuracy and ensuring the authenticity of the
          transmission throughout Noh’s history.

        <h3 id="Chant">Chant – <em>utaibon</em></h3>
        <p>
          The most popular and important notation for Noh drama is the
          <em>utaibon</em>, which means ‘chanting book.’ Compared to a libretto,
          a <em>utaibon</em> contains the dramatic text of a Noh play with the
          indication of roles including the shite, waki, and jiutai. However, it
          does not include Interlude section between two acts, performed mainly
          by ai-kyogen, because the <em>utaibon</em> functions more like a
          chanting notation rather than a play script. Sung text is annotated on
          the right side of the notation with dot-like signs indicating how each
          syllable or line is sung (Fig.1).

        <p>
          After 17th century, as the amateur population was growing, the
          <em>utaibon</em> was printed repeatedly, becoming one of bestsellers
          through the Japanese history. 20th century’s utaibon has been revised
          to include the synopsis, costumes, and masks used on stage rather than
          as a mere notation for chanting (Fig.2).

        <h3 id="Dance">Dance – <em>katatsuke</em></h3>
        <p>
          Increasing numbers of amateurs through 20th century led the
          headmasters of the shite’s schools to publish the choreography of the
          climactic part, <em>shimai</em>, in Noh plays. Movement patterns
          called <em>kata</em>, mostly indicated by their particular names, are
          written down side-by-side with the sung text (Fig.3).

        <p>
          In early 20th century, some schools used diagrams to show students how
          to walk on stage in specific sections of a dance (Fig.4).

        <h3 id="Percussion">Percussion – <em>testuke</em></h3>
        <p>
          Compared to chant and dance, percussion performance, kotsuzumi,
          ōtsuzumi and taiko have not been practiced by many amateurs. Notation
          was not easy for beginners to understand. The original form of
          percussion notation consisted of names of patterns listed in the order
          they were to be performed (Fig. 5 & 6).

        <p>
          Following the increase of amateur players in the 20th century, some
          schools of drumming have published notation books with a clearer style
          that places all strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> vertically over eight
          beats frame, marked with lines (Fig.7). Chanted text or nohkan melody
          were then added, helping the percussion players synchronize their
          strokes and <em>kakegoe</em> to singing or nohkan melody.

        <h3 id="Nohkan">Nohkan</h3>
        <p>
          Nohkan uses oral notation called <em>shōga</em>, widely used for
          learning Japanese wind instruments. In Nohkan, <em>shōga</em> consists
          of fixed sets of Japanese syllables such as <em>o-hya-ra</em> or
          <em>hi-u-i-ya</em>, which remind players of particular basic melodies
          produced by fixed combinations of fingering patterns (Fig. 8 & 9).
          Having basic <em>shōga</em> melodies in mind, individual nohkan
          players create unique embellishments with fingerings added to the
          basic patterns.

        <h3 id="Score">Full Score</h3>
        <p>
          Having five schools for the shite’s chant and two to five schools for
          each instrument, the number of combinations of parts from all
          different schools are close to infinite. This is why full scores of
          Noh plays have rarely been created or published. In the history of
          transmission, however, some publications chose a single school for
          each part and notated chant and percussion patterns side-by-side,
          often using different colors (Fig.10). It may not have been useful for
          students of individual parts but it is invaluable for those who are
          eager to analyze Noh music. The
          <a href="/music/#Notation">notation used on this website</a> is meant
          to serve a similar purpose.
