        <p>
          There are two taiko schools: Komparu and Kanze. Featured NAKATA Hiromi
          and all musical examples are from the Komparu tradition.

        <h3 id="Strokes">Strokes</h3>
        <p>
          There are five basic sounds and one soundless motion
          (<em>kesubachi</em>) produced on the taiko drum:

        <h3 id="Kakegoe">Kakegoe</h3>
        <p>
          The taiko players use the following kakegoe:
          <em>yo, ho, iyo and yoi</em> (<em>ei</em> in Kanze school). The exact
          pronunciation of vowels as well as dynamic and melodic shape can
          significantly vary depending on the dramatic context, school and
          performer. Click below to hear examples of calls for the Komparu
          tradition:

        <h3 id="Patterns">Rhythmic Organization</h3>
        <p>
          The sounds of the taiko are sequenced to create patterns. Most
          patterns are eight beats long and typically start on the 2nd or 6th
          beat of the 8-beat metric unit (<em>honji</em>). However, there are
          patterns as short as two and as long as forty-eight beats. The
          patterns are sequenced into larger phrases and sections. They are
          selected and ordered according to various sets of rules based on their
          formal function. A pattern can assume one of the following functions:
          Head, First Transition, Ground, Second Transition, or Closing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following figure shows an example of how patterns are sequenced to
          create a cycle.

        <p>
          This sequence from Head to Closing and back to Head, which follows the
          Section Opening, functions as a cycle that may be repeated until the
          Closing Section patterns end the module. The Ground pattern can repeat
          multiple times before moving to a pattern from another category. The
          cycle is unidirectional and normally closes with the Head pattern. As
          the sequence moves to a new cycle, a different pattern for each
          category can be used, but the decision about the selection, repetition
          of a pattern, and/or the omission of a specific category is strictly
          prescribed and memorized by the performers.
        </p>

        <p>Here is an example of a basic sequence of rhythmic patterns.</p>

        <h4>Sequence of patterns in Kokaji's Maibataraki</h4>
        <p>
          The <em>Maibataraki</em> dance from Kokaji follows immediately a
          <em>Noriji</em> chant. The Closing pattern, <em>uchikomi</em>, which
          begins the recording, followed by the Head pattern, <em>kashira</em>,
          close the chant module and signal the imminent beginning of the
          <em>Maibataraki</em>, whose principal rhythmic sequence starts with
          the Head pattern, <em>tsuke gashira</em> (third line). The last
          <em>uchikomi</em> and <em>kashira</em> patterns (fifth and sixth
          lines) form the danceâ€™s Closing section.
