            The spoken sections called <em>kotoba</em> consist of non-rhythmical
            prose intoned with a full voice. Usually, sentences are divided into
            two parts: a gradual rising tone reaching a peak followed by a
            falling off. In the text transcription of the
            /Users/Jarek/noh-website/noh/src/ excerpts the colored syllables are
            used to identify the higher pitches that lead to a descent.

          <p>
            <br />
            Sections in <em>kotoba</em> are always delivered by an actor, never
            by the jiutai. The difference in style between the shite's and
            waki's kotoba can be heard in the following three examples:
            <br />Hashitomi/Nanori – waki <br />Kokaji/Nanori – waki tsure
            <br />Kokaji/Mondō – shite and waki.

          and waki (sword maker). The former sits on the left, and the latter on
          the right. This example offers two points of comparison between the
          kotoba styles of shite and waki." paragraph2="The first point relates
          to the gradual rising tone. While they both use a rising line to get
          to a peak-tone, the overall ascent of the shite’s line is more subdued
          compared with the waki’s. The second point relates to the rhythm of
          delivery, the shite’s being much slower than the waki."
          paragraph3="These are not to be understood as universal stylistic
          characteristics, but rather as performance differences, the shite’s
          less flamboyant style being well suited for a deity rather than a mere
          human played by the waki." %}

            The chanted music called <em>utai</em> can be sung in two different
            styles: <em>yowagin</em> – a gentler melodic singing and
            <em>tsuyogin</em> – a more forceful and dramatic one.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Yowagin">Yowagin</h3>
          <p>
            When singing in yowagin style, the actor uses a modest vibrato
            producing melodies with clearly perceptible stable pitches. This
            style is used for passages expressing elegance and pathos.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘tonic’ of a chant in Nō is not absolute but determined by the
            performer, however the chant’s intervals are fixed. The entire range
            covers two octaves and it is divided up into four register zones:
            Very low, Low, Prime, and High, each one covering more or less the
            span of a perfect fourth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pitches being relative they are referred to by name rather than by
            pitch. The three most important pitches are the Low, Medium, and
            High (in our example B2, E3, and A3 respectively), and the majority
            of the chants are set around these three pole-pitches. Intermediate
            pitches are used to melodically flow from one of these pole-pitches
            to another. Finally, the lower and higher ranges are extended with
            the addition of the low ryo and the ryo (E2 and F#2 respectively)
            for the former, and the kuri and high kuri (C4 and E4 respectively)
            for that later.

          after the pitch kuri from the higher register. For the most part, the
          pitch material of the piece focuses on the High pitch with few

          paragraph2="Upon reaching the kuri’s signature cadential melisma, the
          hon-yuri, the pitch material switches to the Medium before cadencing
          on the Low. (The pitch material in this performance is a major second
          lower than the one shown in the Figure above)."%}

          <h3 id="Tsuyogin">Tsuyogin</h3>

          <p>
            While singing in tsuyogin style, the actor uses a notable vibrato
            with utterances usually contained within a small range span. This
            style is used for most dramatic passages such as those expressing
            excitement, bravery, or solemnity.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The actors are not attempting to produce specific melodic pitches.
            Their singing oscillates mainly within a minor third shown below as
            Low and Medium/High tones. However, at specific moments the
            Medium/High tone is embellished by higher tones.
