        <h2><em>Tome no te</em></h2>
        <p>
          The pattern consists of two phrases with the following <em>shōga</em>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >o-hya ri ya ri<br />
            hi-hyo ru ri
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following examples illustrate the difference in expressive
          inflection given to basic patterns in contrasting contexts. The
          <em>Tome no te</em> pattern, often played at the end of a play, is
          first heard in its ‘generic’ form, and then performed in Kokaji’s
          <em>Kiri</em>, involving a male deity, and in Hashitomi’s
          <em>Kiri</em>, showcasing a young maiden. The stronger attack and
          faster speed of the former, fitting in the context of a divine being,
          contrast in the latter with a softer attack and slower speed to
          reflect the character of a lady. Also Hashitomi's <em>Tome no te</em>,
          slightly differs from the 'generic' pattern, since the bright last
          '<em>ri</em>' of the first line is not played. This is shown in the
          video with parenthesis '(ri)'. In fact, in Hashitomi the
          <em>Tome no te</em> pattern leads to the high and shrilling
          <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi" target="_blank"><em>hishigi</em></a>
          pattern, not included in this video. Thus, one could stipulates that
          it is to save the higher range for that last pattern, that the
          '<em>ri</em>' is left out in the <em>Tome no te's</em> first line.
