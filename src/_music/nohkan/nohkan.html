        <h2 id="Nohkan">Nohkan (Flute)</h2>
        <p>
          There are three nohkan schools: Morita, Issō and Fujita. Featured
          MORITA Yasuyoshi is from the Morita tradition.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Sound">Sound</h3>
        <p>
          The scale of this seven-hole instrument, member of the traverse flute
          family, is unusual because of a thin bamboo tube called <em>nodo</em>,
          inserted between its mouth hole and first finger hole. The nodo
          distorts the natural acoustic behavior of the pipe and as a result,
          its scale consists of microtonal pitches that do not fit any
          predefined mode and vary from instrument to instrument. According to
          some sources, the <em>nodo</em> helps produce <em>hishigi</em>, the
          highest pitch on the instrument, and is a crucial note of structurally
          important patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following figure shows the approximate principle pitches produced
          by one particular nohkan (half-hole pitches were not recorded). The
          row of pitches on the second system are the continuation of the first
          and are produced with an increased airflow using the exact same
          fingerings as the first. In the case of most world flutes, as well as
          other Japanese traverse flutes like the ryūteki, komabue, and
          kagurabue, such overblowing would consistently produce pitches an
          octave higher and as a result, extend the same scale. In the case of
          nohkan, the overblowing of the lowest note creates a pitch that is a
          minor tenth higher, and with every following note, that interval
          diminishes so the resulting interval of overblowing the highest note
          is a major sixth. The increased air pressure process adds a new set of
          pitches to the overall scale.

        title="Nohkan Scale" %}
        <p>
          Whereas Western flutists use the distal phalanges to cover the
          instrument's key and holes, the nohkan players use their intermediate
          phalanges allowing for very subtle half-holing that produces
          additional microtonal fluctuations in the pitch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The microtonal and unregulated pitch material of the nohkan functions
          independently from the singers. The primary actor during a performance
          sets the chant's central pitch, independent from the nohkan's pitches.
          The overall compatibility of energy and pitch responds to the
          circumstances and spirit of a particular performance. This freedom
          between the pitch material of the actors and the nohkan is also
          facilitated by their separation in range, since the nohkan much higher
          than the chant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mode of attack is another important factor that adds to the
          richness of nohkan's sound palette. When enunciating a new note, the
          air pressure controlled by the diaphragm allows for different
          sharpness of attacks from sudden to slurred. Tonguing, a common
          performance practice of the West, involving making a silent use of
          syllables like "ta" or "da" to break the flow of air, is not used.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Patterns">Melodic Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          The nohkan creates an ambiance that reflects the particular emotions
          of the play, the status or psychological mindset of a character in a
          given <em>shōdan</em>, and underlines the dramatic structure. This is
          achieved using a collection of just over a hundred melodic patterns
          and pieces that are shared between different plays. This fixed melodic
          repertoire consists of different kinds of material:
          <em>ashirai</em> patterns, which are relatively short and are used
          multiple times throughout each play; special patterns associated with
          particular emotions or situations, such as love, shinto rituals,
          purifications, or mantra chanting; pieces that accompany dance,
          entrances and exits; and pieces used exclusively for kyōgen. In Morita
          school, there are around 20 <em>ashirai</em> patterns, 80 special
          patterns and pieces for entrance, exit and dance (the number includes
          variations such as different introduction patterns for dances) and 12
          pieces for kyōgen. Performers inflect expressive characteristics on
          the same patterns, which serve the demands of a specific play, section
          and structural moment and add to the immense richness of the nohkan
          music.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help the user better appreciate the expressive transformation of
          the same pattern, we asked MORITA Yasuyoshi to perform 'generic'
          versions of some patterns, whose use in the two plays can then be
          compared. He was at first reluctant, since no 'generic' versions are
          ever performed. Patterns are always learned and played in the context
          of a specific play, with a particular character in mind. We appreciate
          the exception he made for this website and its educational purpose.
          Within the catalogue that follows, two patterns,
          <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"
            ><em>naka no takane</em></a
          >
          and
          <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari" target="_blank"
            ><em>takane mi kusari</em></a
          >, are first played in their 'generic' form and then played as
          performed in Kokaji <em>Kuse</em>, involving a male god, as opposed to
          Hashitomi <em>Kuse</em>, which involves a young maiden.
        </p>

        <p>
          The transmission of music for nohkan is primarily oral. To help
          memorization, performers use a system of mnemonics, called
          <em>shōga</em>. These are also notated. Specific combinations of
          syllables represent specific melodic contour. The use of vowels
          suggests the direction of pitch; if ordered from highest to lowest,
          these are i, a, o and u. However, there is no fixed relationship
          between a single mnemonic syllable and specific pitch or fingering. As
          a result, written notation has only a secondary role and is not
          sufficient. Examples of mnemonics include
          <em>o, u, hi, ra, ri, ru, ro, hya, hyu, and hyo,</em> among others.
          For example, the <em>shōga</em> for <em>takane</em> is "<em
            >o-hya ra</em
          >." It is important to note that each syllable represents a sound
          often composed of a sequence of pitches rather than a single one.
          <em>Shōga</em> does not carry any information about its duration,
          since it changes depending on context.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, a word about the <em>hishigi</em>, a shrill, high-pitched
          tone that is rarely used within melodies. It is used primarily as a
          powerful and striking effect sometimes described as an invocation of
          the gods. It often marks the end of a play, or the beginning or end of
          a <em>shōdan</em>.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Catalog">Selected Examples</h4>
        <p>
          In presenting this selection of melodic materials, our objective was
          to record only the principal nine <em>ashirai</em> patterns that can
          be heard in one or both of the plays featured on this website: Kokaji
          and Hashitomi. For some context, in the notation book of Morita
          School, fourteen patterns appear in the play Funabenkei, only five in
          Soshi Arai Komachi, fifteen in Kokaji, and eight in Hashitomi.
        </p>
        {% include nohkan-patterns.html %}
        <p></p>
        <p>
          To illustrate how patterns articulate the structure of a
          <em>shōdan</em>, we will use the example of an <em>Ageuta</em>. Three
          melodic patterns are usually performed during an <em>Ageuta</em> (a
          sung section): <em>takane, naka no takane,</em> and
          <em>mi roku no ge</em>. They stand out because they are relatively
          short, and each appear only once and as distinct utterances, played at
          their own specific point in the <em>shōdan</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, the sequence of the patterns accentuates the melodic shape of
          the chant, which starts in the higher range, moves to the middle, and
          closes in the low range. This descent is imitated by the nohkan's
          sequence of patterns, which start with <em>takane</em> followed by
          <em>naka no takane</em>, both in the instrument's higher range
          followed by the <em>mi roku no ge</em>, whose melodic contour moves
          from the medium to the low range.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, the positioning of the patterns also underlines the structure
          of the text, which is characterized by a repeated first and last line.
          The reiteration of the first line is preceded by the nohkan's
          <em>takane</em> pattern, while the first statement of the last line of
          text is underlined by the entrance of the
          <em>mi roku no ge</em> pattern. The <em>naka no takane</em> does not
          have a specific position, but it is usually played when the vocal line
          is about to move from the higher to the medium range.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are exceptions to this basic structure. For instance, the
          <em>naka no takane</em> is left out from the first
          <em>Ageuta</em> from Hashitomi, shown in the video. Its second
          <em>Ageuta</em> is even shorter, and only includes the first nohkan
          pattern, <em>takane</em>.
        </p>

        %}

        <h3 id="Rhythm">Rhythm</h3>
        <p>
          The nohkan performs solo, with the percussion instruments or with
          percussion instruments and voice. It never plays with the voice alone.
          For the majority of its repertoire, the nohkan’s part is
          non-congruent, meaning that it is not synchronized to specific beats
          within the eight-beat unit. Depending on the situation, the nohkan
          player relies on either the text, the position of an actor on the
          stage, or an approximate point within the eight-beat unit to determine
          the beginning and end of their melodic pattern. For instance, when
          playing the solo piece <em>Nanoribue</em>, an entrance music commonly
          played as the waki is walking onto the stage, the pace of the
          performance is guided by the time taken by the actor to walk from his
          entrance point to the speech position.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Nanoribue</em> is based on three <em>ashirai</em> patterns:
          <em>naka no takane</em>, <em>roku no ge</em>, and an unnamed third one
          exclusive to the <em>Nanoribue</em>.
        </p>

        {% include video-no-background.html
        src="https://d3msn78fivoryj.cloudfront.net/Shodan_sl/Nohkan-Hashitomi-Nanoribue_sl.mp4"
        %}
        <p>
          When performing with the percussion instruments, there are three
          different types of possible rhythmic arrangements:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. The nohkan part is congruent<br />
          2. The nohkan part is non-congruent and set against a strict
          percussion part.<br />
          3. The nohkan part is non-congruent and set against a flexible
          percussion part.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Congruent">Congruent</h4>
        <p>
          TThe nohkan part is 'congruent' (<em>awase-buki</em>) when it aligns
          with specific beats of the <em>honji</em>. This is most typically
          encountered in dances and entrance and exit music. In these instances,
          the nohkan’s melodic patterns almost always start on the
          <em>honji’s</em> second beat or its second half. Its material is
          developed from short motives that are juxtaposed to create a larger
          melodic cell. For instance, the melody that accompanies the dance
          <em>Maibataraki</em>, found on this website, is composed of three
          melodic motives—a, b, c—and each letter corresponds to an eight-beat
          melody. These motives performed as a set create a twenty-four-beat
          long melody. On the other hand, the <em>Jonomai’s</em> core melody,
          called <em>Ji</em>, is composed of four patterns, each eight-beats
          long, labelled <em>Chū, Kan, Kan no chū,</em> and <em>Ryo</em>.

        <h4 id="Non-congruent-Strict">Non-congruent in Strict Setting</h4>
        <p>
          A nohkan's part is 'non-congruent' (<em>ashirai-buki</em>) when it
          does not align with the beats of the honji. We’ve included an example
          of it against a strict percussion part in an excerpt from the
          <em>Issei</em>-music from Hagoromo. This is an entrance music that
          typically leads to the <em>Issei</em>-chant, in which the percussion’s
          strict rhythmic setting is maintained against a non-congruent chant.
          After having articulated the beginning of the module with the
          <em>Hishigi</em> pattern, the nohkan players waits for the fourth
          <em>honji</em> to freely position the <em>naka no takane</em> pattern
          in the span of two <em>honji</em>. .

          typically leads to the <em>Shidai</em>-chant, in which the percussion
