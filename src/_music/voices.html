        <h2 id="Sound">Vocal Sound</h2>
        <p>
          The vocal production in Noh is highly stylized. It is based on
          diaphragmatic breathing that reverberates through the head, chest and
          oral cavity. It should project sufficient loudness even when the
          singer wears a mask.
        </p>

        <p>
          The vocal tone-center is relative. The first person who starts a chant
          instigates the central tone, and that tone range is informed by the
          character he is impersonating. The secondary actor signals his lower
          position by providing lighter, faster and higher tones (for example,
          Wakizure in Kokaji). Larger width of the range indicates the
          protagonist is a man while a narrower range indicates a woman.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two general styles of <em>utai</em>: spoken and chanted.
          Both are intoned in full voice, but never in falsetto.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Spoken">Spoken</h3>
        <p>
          The spoken sections, called <em>kotoba</em>, consist of unmetered
          prose. Usually the recitation divides a sentence into two parts: a
          gradual rising tone reaching a peak followed by a falling off. The
          highest tone falls on the second syllable of the second part. In the
          text transcription of the excerpts, syllables in bold identify the
          higher tones that lead to a descent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections in <em>kotoba</em> are always delivered by an actor or two,
          but never by the jiutai. When considering the dramatic unfolding of a
          play, the difference between the two is important. The text delivered
          in <em>kotoba</em> by a single actor tends to be factual, whereas
          spoken text between two actors usually carries information that
          furthers and nourishes the unfolding drama.
        </p>

        <p>
          The difference in style between the shite's and waki's
          <em>kotoba</em> can be heard in the following three examples:

        <h3 id="Chanted">Chanted</h3>
        <p>
          The chanted music, called <em>utai</em>, can be sung in two different
          styles: <em>yowagin</em>, a gentler melodic singing, and
          <em>tsuyogin</em>, a more forceful and dramatic style.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Yowagin">Yowagin</h4>
        <p>
          When singing in <em>yowagin</em> style, the actor uses a modest
          vibrato, producing melodies with perceptible stable tones. This style
          is common in passages expressing elegance and pathos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the tonal center of a chant in Noh is not absolute and is
          instead determined by the performer, the chant’s intervals are fixed.
          The entire range covers two octaves and is divided into four register
          zones: Very Low, Low, Medium, and High, each one covering more or less
          the span of a perfect fourth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since tones are relative, they are referred to by a general name. The
          three most important tones are the Low, Medium, and High (in our
          example B2, E3, and A3 respectively), and the majority of the chants
          are set around these three nuclear-tones. Intermediate tones are used
          to melodically flow from one nuclear-tone to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the lower and higher ranges are extended with the addition of
          the low <em>ryo</em> and the <em>ryo</em> (E2 and F#2 respectively)
          for the former, and the <em>kuri</em> and high <em>kuri</em> (C4 and
          E4 respectively) for that latter.
        </p>

        link="Yowagin" title="Hagoromo/Kuri" paragraph1="The module is named
        after the <em>kuri </em> tone from the higher register. For the most
        part, the melodic material of the piece focuses on the High tone with
        few incursions on the <em>kuri</em>, shown in bold in the text of the
        video." paragraph2="Upon reaching the <em>kuri</em>’s signature
        cadential melisma, the <em>hon-yuri</em>, the melodic material switches
        to Medium before cadencing on the Low. (The pitch material in this
        performance is a major second lower than the one shown in the figure
        above)." paragraph3="The registers in the video are symbolized by the
        following letters: L (Low), M (Medium), H (High), K (Kuri)." %}

        <h4 id="Tsuyogin">Tsuyogin</h4>

        <p>
          While singing in <em>tsuyogin</em> style, the actor uses a notable
          vibrato with utterances usually contained within a small range span.
          This style is used for most dramatic passages expressing events and
          emotions like celebration, excitement, bravery, or solemnity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actors do not attempt to produce specific melodic tones. Their
          singing oscillates mainly within a minor third shown below as Low and
          High tones. However, at specific moments the High tone is embellished
          with higher ones.

        <h2 id="Rhythm">Vocal Rhythm</h2>

        <p>
          The vocal parts fall into two main categories of rhythm: congruent
          when their parts align with specific beats, and non-congruent when
          they do not.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Congruent">Congruent (<em>hyōshi-ai</em>)</h3>
        <p>
          A Noh chant is said to be congruent when its syllables coincide with
          the measure’s beats. There are three possible congruent settings:
          <a href="/music/voices#Hiranori" target="_blank"><em>hiranori</em></a
          >, <a href="/music/voices#Onori" target="_blank"><em>ōnori</em></a
          >, and
          <a href="/music/voices#Chunori" target="_blank"><em>chūnori</em></a
          >.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Hiranori">Hiranori</h4>

        <p>
          Verse consisting of alternating lines of seven and five syllables is
          the most lyrical and elegant form of Japanese poetry, as seen in
          haiku, waka, and renga, among other poetic forms. <em>Hiranori</em> is
          the basic rhythmic form used in Noh where the poetic twelve syllables
          match with the <em>honji</em>’s eight-beat. Considering that there is
          a possibility of two syllables per beat for a total of sixteen
          syllables per <em>honji</em>, this leaves space for four caesuras. The
          standard positions for the caesuras are on beats 1, 3, 5 and 8,
          dividing the <em>honji</em> in two asymmetric hemistichs: one of four
          beats and a half, the other one with three beats and a half.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <em>hiranori</em> setting has two singing styles:
          <a href="/music/voices/#Tsuzuke-Utai" target="_blank"
            ><em>tsuzuke-utai</em></a
          >
          and
          <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"
            ><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a
          >. The explanation of the two individual styles is followed by a
          <a href="/music/voices/#Demonstration" target="_blank"
            >demonstration in context</a
          >, which shows how they can complement each other in a chant. The
          following examples are based on Hashitomi’s first <em>Ageuta</em>.

                  In <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, singers hold syllables over the
                  first, third, and fifth beats, so that the twelve syllables
                  fit within the <em>honji</em>. In other words, the text is
                  manipulated for the benefit of a steady metric structure, and
                  the eight beats of the unit are divided periodically.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The example below shows an academic distribution of the twelve
                  syllables in two groups of seven and five; the group of seven
                  syllables broken into 1 + 3 + 3, with the first syllable
                  starting on the upbeat preceding the very first beat. The
                  figure also shows that the syllables preceding the first,
                  third, and fifth beats are held over the downbeat, as if to
                  avoid competing with the drums' strong strokes that usually
                  fall on at least one of these downbeats. The fourth caesura
                  occurs on the eighth downbeat in order to separate the two
                  lines.

                  When singing in <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, syllables rarely carry
                  over since the <em>honji</em> is condensed to fit the text. In
                  other words, the metric structure is manipulated for the
                  benefit of the text's declamation. Therefore, the eight beats
                  of the unit are not periodic. Compared with
                  <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, a setting in <em>mitsuji-utai</em> is

                  In the context of a chant, performers use
                  <em>mitsuji-utai</em> and <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> alternately to
                  vary and control the rhythmic flow of the chant. The changes
                  from <em>mitsuji-utai</em> to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> are not
                  left at the discretion of the performers though; rather the
                  music is prescribed, and it typically includes back and forth
                  transition between the two. The cycle <em>mitsuji</em>- to
                  <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> always starts with
                  <em>mitsuji-utai</em> leading to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, which
                  either creates a cadential pattern or to another
                  <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, to start another cycle.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is noteworthy that performers usually use sparse

                  percussion patterns to accompany the part of a chant set in
                  the declamatory <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, where the limited
                  number of percussion strokes is counter-balanced by the
                  melodic line unfolding with few or no rests. On the other

                  patterns usually accompany part of a chant set in the

                  accommodate the measure’s eight beats create rest in the

                  Here is the actual text setting for the first
                  <em>Ageuta</em> from Hashitomi. Because this chant is rather
                  short, it includes only one motion from
                  <em>mitsuji-utai</em> to <em>tsuzuke-utai</em>, with the first
                  three lines set in <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, accompanied with
                  sparse <em>mitsuji</em> patterns in the percussion, and the
                  last three in <em>tsuzuke-utai</em> accompanied with steady
                  <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns in the percussion.

                <p>
                  As is typical of an <em>Ageuta</em>, its first sentence is
                  repeated. The iteration is preceded by an

        <h4 id="Chunori">Chūnori</h4>

        <p>
          Text set in <em>chūnori</em> has two syllables per beat. The first
          syllable of each line of text typically comes on the first or first
          beat and a half, with a complete line finishing within the span of a
          single <em>honji</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of its lively quality, this text setting is often used for
          description of an active moment, such as a battle. Although, it is
          common practice for a <em>shōdan</em> whose text is set to
          <em>chūnori</em> to also include passages set in <em>hiranori</em>,
          the eight-beat units (<em>honji</em>) is almost never contracted, like
          in <em>mitsuji-utai</em>, rather it remains steady.

        <h4 id="TextSetting">Text setting exceptions</h4>

        <p>
          Occasionally, lines of text do not fit within the 7 + 5 model. The
          number of syllables for the first hemistich can vary between two and
          ten, and three and eight for the second one. There are two methods
          that allow for the rhythmic adjustment of syllables: the first one
          involves starting the line's first syllable on a different beat,
          whereas the second method involves the insertion of measures of
          various sizes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The standard position for the first syllable of a line of text is on
          the upbeat leading to the <em>honji's</em> first downbeat. Thus, one
          method of fitting a larger than twelve syllables line of text within a
          <em>honji</em> consist of starting its first syllable earlier than the
          standard upbeat to the first beat. For example, the last line of text
          of Hashitomi’s first <em>Ageuta</em> is comprised of thirteen
          syllables: 8 + 5.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/FirstMethod-Text.png" %}

        <p>
          In this case, ‘Ta,’ the first syllable, starts on the eighth downbeat
          as seen below instead of the usual upbeat to the very first beat:
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/FirstMethod-Rhythm.png" %}

        <p>
          The second method of setting lines of text that exceed twelve
          syllables consists of introducing measures of two (<em>okuriji</em>),
          four (<em>toriji</em>), or six (<em>kataji</em>) beats. For example,
          here are the first three lines of Kokaji’s <em>Kiri</em>. Its syllabic
          structure is: 7 + 5, 7 + 6, and 9 + 5.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/2ndMethod-Text.png" %}
        <p>
          A <em>toriji</em> (measure of four beats) has been inserted between
          the second and third <em>honji</em> (eight beat unit) in order to
          counter-balance the odd syllabic structure of the text. When it comes
          to measures other than the <em>honji</em>, the <em>toriji</em> is far
          more common that the two- and six-beat measures.

        <h3 id="Non-congruent">Non-congruent (<em>hyōshi-awazu</em>)</h3>

        <p>
          The emphasis for non-congruent chants is on the text and melodic line.
          With this text setting there is no coordination between syllables and
          the unit’s eight beats. There are two types of non-congruent chant:
          <em>sashinori</em> and <em>einori</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Sashinori</em> chant is always accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and
          kotsuzumi in a flexible setting, while <em>einori</em> chant can be
          accompanied by the hand percussion instruments in either strict or
          flexible setting. If the chant includes a nohkan part it will also be
          non-congruent.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Sashinori">Sashinori</h4>

        <p>
          <em>Sashinori</em> chants are sung in a recitative style, accompanied
          by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi in flexible setting, favoring the sparse
          <em>mitsuji</em> patterns. On the other hand, the <em>Kuri</em> also
          accompanied by the two hand-drums in flexible setting, favors the
          <em>tsuzuke</em> pattern. There is a Japanese expression that
          describes well the idea behind a non-congruent chant accompanied by
          percussions in flexible rhythmic setting: <em>fusoku furi</em> which
          means ‘not separate but not together’.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <em>Sashi</em> from Kokaji, sung in <em>tsuyogin</em> mode, is
          composed of two parts. Each one begins by a solo performed the shite
          followed by a reply by the jiutai. The reply is broken up into melodic
          lines rhythmically characterized by a slightly accelerated pulse that
          becomes a sustained tone. The sustained tones are positioned on
          syllables that reinforce the text's structure or meaning. For the most
          part, each line stays on the high tone, usually preceded with an
          inflection from below. Finally, the chant concludes on the low tone.
        </p>

        <p>
          The score provided for this excerpt shows the first part is composed
          of six lines, each concluded by a sustained tone: the shite presents
          the first, the jiutai the next five, identified in the score with the
          numbers 1 to 6. It is the two percussionists' responsibility to
          position their four <em>mitsuji</em> patterns against these six lines.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Einori">Einori</h4>

        <p>
          <em>Einori</em> chants are usually accompanied by the ōtsuzumi and
          kotsuzumi in strict setting. The <em>Issei-</em>chant from Hashitomi
          is sung in <em>yowagin</em> style, focusing on only four tones: the
          Medium and High, and their respective Intermediate tones a second
          lower. It is divided up into two segments: the first one sung by the
          shite, the second one by the jiutai.
        </p>

        <p>
          The hand-percussion instruments start both parts with sparse
          <em>mitsuji</em> patterns before moving on with
          <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns. It is while performing the
          <em>mitsuji</em> patterns that the ōtsuzumi player has some
          flexibility to adapt to the melodic line. This is particularly clear
          with this recording. The ōtsuzumi player uses flexible
          <em>kakegoe</em> when performing the first <em>mitsuji</em> patterns,
          whereas the kotsuzumi player uses the strict
          <em>kakegoe</em> throughout the chant.
