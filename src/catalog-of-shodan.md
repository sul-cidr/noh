    <h2>Catalog of Shōdan</h2>
    <p>
      The following partial catalog is limited to modules (<em>shōdan</em>) from the two plays featured in this website: Kokaji and
      Hashitomi. To prioritize information about musical characteristics the <em>shōdan</em> were recorded in a
      recital-style performance, and the videos overlaid with simplified notation. </p>
