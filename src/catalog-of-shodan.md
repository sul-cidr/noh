    <p>
      The following partial catalog is limited to modules (<em>shōdan</em>) from
      the two plays featured in this website: Kokaji and Hashitomi. To
      prioritize information about musical characteristics the
      <em>shōdan</em> were recorded in a recital-style performance, and the
      videos overlaid with simplified notation.
