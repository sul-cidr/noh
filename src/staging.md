    <h2>Stage Elements of Noh</h2>

    <p>Filled with symbolism, Noh is first and foremost an evocative dramatic artform rather than a representative one, and this is very much reflected in the treatment of its physical elements such as: stage, masks, costumes, and properties.
</p><p>
Although properties are sometimes used, the bare stage is the common space to all plays. Besides few exceptions,  props are symbolic rather than actual representation of for instance, a dwelling as in Hashitomi, or a forge, as in Kokaji.</p><p>

Symbolism is also behind the selection of a costume, since in choosing one, the actor considers primarily the image he wants his character to project.</p><p>

Understanding the unsaid suggested by each physical element helps one better appreciate the depth and breadth of a play.</p>
