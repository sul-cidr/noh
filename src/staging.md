    <h2>Stage Elements of Noh</h2>

    <p>
      Filled with symbolism, Noh is first and foremost an evocative dramatic
      artform rather than a representative one, and this is very much reflected
      in the treatment of its physical elements such as: stage, masks, costumes,
      and properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although properties are sometimes used, the bare stage is the common space
      to all plays. Besides few exceptions, props are symbolic rather than
      actual representation of for instance, a dwelling as in Hashitomi, or a
      forge, as in Kokaji.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbolism is also behind the selection of a costume, since in choosing
      one, the actor considers primarily the image he wants his character to
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding the unsaid suggested by each physical element helps one
      better appreciate the depth and breadth of a play.
