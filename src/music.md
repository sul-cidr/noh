    <h2>Elements of Music: an Introduction</h2>

    <p>Noh from a Western perspective can be considered a form of opera. It is a staged theatrical form in which actors sing their parts accompanied by an ensemble. The music plays a primary role in its expression. But unlike Western opera, which puts the composer's original creative act at its center, the music in Noh has no original music composed for individual plays. All plays share the same musical building blocks, <a href="#">rhythmic</a> and <a href="#">melodic patterns</a> that are organized to outline and support specific dramatic needs. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times within a single play and in different sections leading to a great unity and self-similarity. But this seeming constriction is more than balanced by enormous number of variants and flexibility with which the modules are utilized and expressively inflected in specific plays and during particular performances. This chapter is intended to introduce the reader to some of these building blocks and how they are put together.</p>

    <p>The performers in Noh plays can be classified according to the role or the instrument they play. The primary actor is the shite and he is usually masked. The secondary actor is the waki. Both shite and waki can have companion actors called tsure. The only actors to dance are the shite and occasionally his tsure. The non-instrumentalists performers also include the chorus, kokata, ai-kyôgen, and kôken. The chorus in Noh assumes different roles in the course of a play, switching between being the narrator and the implied voice of the shite or waki.</p>

    <p>The hayashi (instrumental ensemble)  in all Noh is comprised of one pitched instrument:  the nohkan (flute), and two unpitched percussion instruments:  the kôtsuzumi  (shoulder drum) and ôtsuzumi (hip drum).  Although the number of plays in the current repertoire varies from school to school, it is approximated to be close to 250. Of that number, about half include a third drum, the taiko (stick drum).  With a few rare exceptions it only joins in for the second half of a play.  The hayashi is not considered to be accompanying the actors and chorus, but it is instead playing with them. In Noh performance, each part is as important as the others, and that is confirmed by the fact that the musicians sit on stage with the actors, and as such they are very much part of not only the sonic but also visual aspect of a play. In technical terms, the function of the hayashi is to create and maintain the proper mood and flow of a play.</p>

    <p>The chapter about elements of music is divided into two sections: an introduction of the sound material and a description of Noh's rhythmic organization. The sound section presents isolated sounds of percussion instruments and an explanation of the nohkan and voice’s pitch systems. The rhythm section presents a selection of patterns for the percussion instruments and  nohkan, the concept of congruency, and different vocal rhythmic settings.</p>

    <p>A clarification must be made about the music notation used on this website. Conversely to Western tradition there are no complete study scores for any given play. Each of the twenty-four schools has their own individual scores and variants of notation (there are five shite, three waki, two ai-kyôgen, five ôtsuzumi, four kôtsuzumi, two taiko, and three nohkan schools). In the performance of a Noh play, it is the school of the shite that becomes the reference and it is the responsibility of the waki and ai-kyôgen actors and musicians to adapt their parts to the shite’s. Scores for individual instruments are written on a grid of eight blocks and they are read from top to bottom and from right to left. On this website, we retained the characteristic note-heads of various percussion instruments’ strokes but set them on a horizontal lines and added stems, following the Western notation standards. All scores combining more than one instrument are our own transcriptions.</p>
