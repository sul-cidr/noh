He asks about            its name. A woman who lends her voice to the flower identifies it as            a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening flower’.          </p>          <p>            Interlude: A local villager in a conversation with the monk tells            the story of Lady Yūgao. We learn that passing through Gojō on his            way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Prince Genji noticed with            admiration the abundant yūgao flowers growing on a dwelling. He            asked his retainer Koremitsu to pluck some. The blossoms came on a            scented fan with a poem written on it by a beautiful woman later            referred to as Lady Yūgao. Genji replied with his own, which led to            a romantic affair. The relationship was short-lived as Lady Yūgao            became possessed by a vengeful spirit.          </p>          <p>            Second Act: The monk visits the house of Lady Yūgao in Gojō.

It also shows            that the play is composed of two acts, and that the first one counts            eight <em>shōdan</em>, against nine for the second act.          </p>          <p>            The color of the blocks shows that most <em>shōdan</em> are bound            into <em>dan</em>. Act I has four <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Shite            Enters, Dialogue, and Shite Exits; whereas Act II has five: Waki            Waits, Shite Re-enters, Dialogue, Shite Performs, and Shite Exits.            Bringing the cursor over a <em>shōdan</em> identifies its name and            the <em>dan</em> it belongs to.          </p>          <p>            A comparison between the duration of the two acts shows that the            first act is about half the duration of the second, suggesting that            the setting-up of the plot in the first act is simpler and less            elaborate than the second act-development.          </p>          <p>            The height of the blocks shows the development of the play’s            <a href="/form/#ITI" target="_blank">Intermedia Texture Index</a>            (ITI). The fluctuating heights demonstrate that the development is            not linear but comes in waves. We have identified three kinds of            waves:          </p>          <p>            First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. There is an important            difference in the way the ITI of each act transforms. In the first            act, the ITI of each <em>dan</em> forms a wave leading to a peak on            its last <em>shōdan</em>. For example, the First act’s Waki enters            is composed on three <em>shōdan</em>, whose index increases            exponentially from the first to the third. The development of the            ITI over the two <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite enters is similar.            Things are different though with the remaining two <em>dan</em>. The            Dialogue, composed of only one <em>shōdan</em>, is followed by the            Shite exits that has two. In this case, it is over their combined            three <em>shōdan</em> that the ITI increases exponentially.          </p>          <p>            Second: the rising wave across an act. There is an important            difference in the way the ITI of each act transforms. The first act            counts three waves. The first two correspond to the entrance of the            Waki and Shite, respectively. The third one corresponds to the            setting of the play’s premise. On the other hand, there is only one            wave in the second act, as the ITI of subsequent <em>dan</em> keeps            increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite performs            <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual but hesitant setting-up            of the plot in the first act, followed by a continuous and steady            development in the second one.          </p>          <p>            Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The ITI is at its            lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its three highest peaks            create a wave that culminates on the third one. The play’s premise            being already set, the ITI at the beginning of Act II is higher than            it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower than the first act’s            peak. But it does not take long for the ITI to recuperate the lost            ground and further exceed the first act’s peak when reaching the            highest ITI with the instrumental dance.          </p>        </div>        <h3 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Performance Credits</h3>        <div>          <p>Shite: KONGŌ Tatsunori (Kongō School)</p>          <p>Waki: ARIMATSU Ryōichi (Takayasu School)</p>          <p>Kyōgen: SHIGEYAMA Shime (Ōkura School).</p>          <p>Ōtsuzumi: TANIGUCHI Masatoshi (Ishii School)</p>          <p>Kotsuzumi: NARITA Tatsushi (Kō School)</p>          <p>Nohkan: MORITA Yasuyoshi (Morita School)</p>          <p>Jiutai: (Kongō School, back row from right)</p>          <p>TESHIMA Kouji,</p>          <p>UDAKA Michishige (leader),</p>          <p>TESHIMA Yukihiro,</p>          <p>TANIGUCHI Masahiko,</p>          <p>(front row from right)</p>          <p>YAMADA Isumi,</p>          <p>SHIGEMOTO Masaya,</p>          <p>TANAKA Toshifumi,</p>          <p>MUKAI Hiroki</p>          <p>Kōken: HIROTA Yukitoshi</p>          <p>Stage assistant: SOUMYOU Tadasuke</p>        </div>      </section>      <br />      <section id="act1" title="Act I" class="tabbed-narrative">        <h2 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11">Act I</h2>        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Waki Enters</h3>        <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">          Composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>dan</em> sets up the scene          for the main character to appear.

The Kongō school’s          <em>utaibon</em> describes the first act shite as a woman, the second          act one as the woman’s spirit, the difference between the two made          visible by the change of          <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Shite1" target="_blank"            >costume</a          >.        </p>        <p data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">          The <em>dan</em> is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and brings the          first definitive move towards congruency, thus initiating the          ascending curve of the Intermedia Index that will peak with the          instrumental dance. Although the first <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence          is still non-congruent, it expands the overall texture with an          <em>einori</em>          <time datetime="00:40:56.000" title="00:40:56">chant</time> for one          voice and jiutai, accompanied by a non-congruent nohkan’s part and the          two hand-percussion instruments already in strict rhythmic setting. It          is followed by two congruent chants, both set in          <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments          still in strict rhythmic setting. The          <time datetime="00:44:42.000" title="00:44:42">first</time> one is          sung by the shite, the          <time datetime="00:45:40.000" title="00:45:40">second</time> one by          the jiutai.        </p>        <p data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">          The rapid development of the <em>dan’s</em> musical texture is          counterbalanced by the absence of any dance movements. Yet, the          staging increases the visual impact in two steps. Firstly, the shite’s          entrance is in voice only. The actor 'appears' by delivering the          <em>issei</em>-chant from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em> draped in a          violet cloth. This creates great mystery and builds anticipation.          Being first heard but not seen is also a beautiful echo of the shite's          similar entrance in the first act. Second, it is about half-way in the          <em>ageuta</em>, when the drape around the <em>tsukurimono</em> is          slowly removed, that the spirit's visual identity is finally revealed.        </p>        <p>          Detailed intermedia analysis: <br />          <a href="/hashitomi/issei/" target="_blank"><em>Issei</em></a          >, <br />          <a href="/hashitomi/sageuta/" target="_blank"><em>Sageuta</em></a          >, <br />          <a href="/hashitomi/ageuta-2/" target="_blank"><em>Ageuta 2</em></a          >.        </p>        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="18">Dialogue</h3>        <p data-highlight-shodans="18">          While the Dialogue <em>dan</em> in Act I was setting the play’s          premise, this <em>dan</em> serves an introduction to the climax of the          play.
