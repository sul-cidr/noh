  <div>
    <p>First act: A monk who is performing a ritual for flowers notices with bewilderment a white one that appears to smile. He asks about its name. A woman who lends her voice to the flower identifies it as a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening flower’. </p>

    <p>Interlude: A local villager in a conversation with the monk tells the story of Lady Yūgao. We learn that passing through Gojō on his way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Prince Genji noticed with admiration the abundant yūgao flowers growing on a dwelling. He asked his retainer Koremitsu to pluck some. The blossoms came on a scented fan with a poem written on it by a beautiful woman later referred to as Lady Yūgao. Genji replied with his own, which led to a romantic affair. The relationship was short-lived as Lady Yūgao became possessed by a vengeful spirit.</p>

    <p>Second Act: The monk visits the house of Lady Yūgao in Gojō. Her spirit appears and reminesces on her first night with Genji, their introduction through yūgao flowers and the exchange of poems written on the fan. </p>

<h3 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Intermedia Form</h3>

  <div>
  <p>The <a href="/form/#shodanmap" target="_blank"><em>Shōdan</em> Map</a> under the video represents the play’s intermedia form. It also shows that the play is composed of two acts, and that the first one counts eight <em>shōdan</em>, against nine for the second act. </p>

  <p>The color of the blocks shows that most <em>shōdan</em> are bound into <em>dan</em>. Act I has four <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Shite Enters, Dialogue, and Shite Exits; whereas Act II has five: Waki Waits, Shite Re-enters, Dialogue, Shite Performs, and Shite Exits. Bringing the cursor over a <em>shōdan</em>  identifies its name and the <em>dan</em> it belongs to. </p>

  <p>A comparison between the duration of the two acts shows that the first act is about half the duration of the second, suggesting that the setting-up of the plot in the first act is simpler and less elaborate than the second act-development. </p>

  <p>The height of the blocks shows the development of the play’s <a href="/form/#ITI" target="_blank">Intermedia Texture Index</a> (ITI). The fluctuating heights demonstrate that the development is not linear but comes in waves. We have identified three kinds of waves: </p>

  <p>First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. There is an important difference in the way the ITI of each act transforms. In the first act, the ITI of each <em>dan</em> forms a wave leading to a peak on its last <em>shōdan</em>. For example, the First act’s Waki enters is composed on three <em>shōdan</em>, whose index increases exponentially from the first to the third. The development of the ITI over the two <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite enters is similar. Things are different though with the remaining two <em>dan</em>. The Dialogue, composed of only one <em>shōdan</em>, is followed by the Shite exits that has two. In this case, it is over their combined three <em>shōdan</em> that the ITI increases exponentially. </p>

  <p>Second: the rising wave across an act. There is an important difference in the way the ITI of each act transforms. The first act counts three waves. The first two correspond to the entrance of the Waki and Shite, respectively. The third one corresponds to the setting of the play’s premise. On the other hand, there is only one wave in the second act, as the ITI of subsequent <em>dan</em> keeps increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite performs <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual but hesitant setting-up of the plot in the first act, followed by a continuous and steady development in the second one. </p>

  <p>Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The ITI is at its lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its three highest peaks create a wave that culminates on the third one. The play’s premise being already set, the ITI at the beginning of Act II is higher than it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower than the first act’s peak. But it does not take long for the ITI to recuperate the lost ground and further exceed the first act’s peak when reaching the highest ITI with the instrumental dance. </p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11">Act I</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Waki Enters</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">Composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>dan</em> sets up the scene for the main character to appear. As it is usually the case, this task is assigned to the secondary actor, the waki.</p>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">As expected, the <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low. It remains non-congruent throughout the expansion of its textures. Yet, the index’s progression over its three <em>shōdan</em> displays a gradual increase in intermedia complexity. The resulting rise of momentum helps prepare the stage for the upcoming entrance of the shite.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="3">The <em>dan</em> opens with <em>Nanoribue</em>, an unmetered <time datetime='00:03:38.000' title='00:03:38'> entrance music </time> played by the nohkan alone. It accompanies the waki as he walks towards the stage. The melody’s free-flowing and calm tone creates a serene ambiance well fitting for the entrance of a Buddhist monk.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="4">Upon reaching Square 1, one of stage’s most restful positions, the waki delivers the <em>Nanori</em>, an unaccompanied <time datetime='00:05:25.000' title='00:05:25'> monologue </time>, introducing himself in prose.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="5">The <em>dan</em>  is concluded by <em>Kakaru 1</em>, a <em>shōdan</em> with a richest texture so far. It mixes <time datetime='00:07:02.000' title='00:07:02'> spoken and chanted text </time>, brings in the two percussion instruments for the first time and positions the waki in the center of the stage. Mimetic elements of prayer and sutra chanting add interest.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="6,7">Shite Enters</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="6,7">The <em>dan’s</em> function is to introduce the protagonist. The shite interrupts the entrance at the First Pine though, saving his entrance onto the stage-proper for a later <em>dan</em>. Composed of only two <em>shōdan</em>, it remains non-congruent throughout. The overall Intermedia Index is low since we are still in the character-introduction phase of the play.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="6"> Like the preceding <em>dan</em>, it opens with a non-congruent <time datetime='00:08:56.000' title='00:08:56'> entrance music </time>, the <em>Ashirai</em>. This time it is performed by the nohkan accompanied by the two percussion instruments. This is the first module involving the full <em>hayashi</em>.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="7">While the waki introduced himself in spoken prose, the shite uses poetry  as he performs the Song in unmetered <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:13:02.000' title='00:13:02'>chant</time>. This raises the Intermedia Index in preparation for the next <em>dan</em>, the dialogue.</p>

    <a href="/hashitomi/ashirai/" target="_blank"><em>Ashirai</em></a>, <br><a href="/hashitomi/song/" target="_blank">Song</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="8">Dialogue</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="8">The Dialogue section consists of only one <em>shōdan</em>. Its function is to set the play’s premise through an exchange between the two actors. As it is often the case it is in this dan that the waki’s curiosity about the shite’s identity is piqued. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="8">The overall Intermedia Index stays low. The <em>shōdan</em> returns <time datetime='00:14:02.000' title='00:14:02'> to spoken prose </time> but includes also some chanting in unmetered <em>sashinori</em> and engages both shite and waki.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="8">The <em>dan</em> is also significant dramatically. The shite not only enters the stage-proper, but also establishes contact with the waki. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="8">Formally, the <em>dan</em> appears to be a preparation for the next one: the Shite Exits. The Intermedia Index shows an energetic curve starting with the Dialogue that climaxes with the <em>Ageuta 1</em>, in the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>.</p>

  <p> Detailed intermedia analysis: <br><a href="/hashitomi/kakeai/" target="_blank"><em>Kakeai</em></a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Shite Performs</h3>
  <p>There is no Shite Performs section in Hashitomi’s first act. The <em>shōdan</em> that traditionally defines this <em>dan</em> – the <em>Kuse</em> – is included in the second act.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="9,10,11">Shite Exits</h3>
  <p>The <em>dan</em> concludes the setting of the play's premise and introduces the basis for narrative continuation in Act II before seeing the shite leave the stage. The Intermedia Index slope shows that it carries on the momentum initiated with the preceding one before reaching the highest peak of Act I. It then leads to a dramatic drop to a silent and slow exit. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="9,10,11">The <em>dan</em> consists of two <em>shōdan</em> followed by a silent exit. As a pair, the two <em>shōdan</em> could be compared to the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/rongi" target="_blank"><em>rongi</em></a>, a <em>shōdan</em> commonly used to close Act I. They follow the same structure: the first part here, the <em>Kakaru 2</em>,is a <time datetime='00:17:29.000' title='00:17:29'> dialogue</time> partially spoken, partially sung in non-congruent setting, followed by a <time datetime='00:18:53.000' title='00:18:52'>poetic</time> and congruent chant, here, the <em>Ageuta 1</em>.</p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="9">The <em>Kakaru 2</em> flows freely as a non-congruent chant with text in prose, accompanied by the percussion instruments in flexible setting. It is delivered as the two protagonists remain essentially motionless in their respective positions. The <em>shōdan</em> concludes with a clue about the shite’s identity. It refers to a mansion whose location is then identified at the very beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="10">This important moment in the dramatic unfolding of the play is underlined by the <em>Ageuta 1</em> , which introduces the first congruent chant in the play and the first entrance of the jiutai. Moreover, in preparation for his exit, and for the first time in the play, the shite performs a sequence of dance <em>kata></em>.</p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="12">Interlude</h2>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="12">Fitting with its typical function and form, the <em>kyōgen</em><time datetime='00:23:17.000' title='00:23:17'>Interlude</time> in Hashitomi sees an un-masked kyōgen actor acting as a well-informed villager engaging in a dialogue with the monk. For most of the <em>shōdan</em> they kneel on the floor and remain almost motionless. We hear a 'plain-spoken' story of Lady Yūgao, which provides the viewers with essential narrative background for the understanding of the main character in the play.</p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22">Act II</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="14">Waki Waits</h3>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="14">The Waki Waits <em>dan</em> restarts the narration and sets the ground for the shite to re-enter. In Hashitomi, the <em>dan</em> is composed just of  one <em>shōdan</em>. A mostly descriptive prose switches to poetry only at its conclusion. It is a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> <time datetime='00:39:23.000' title='00:39:23'>chant</time> for one voice, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting and performed almost without motion. The overal Intermedia Index stays in the lower range. </p>


  <p> Detailed intermedia analysis: <br>
    <a href="/hashitomi/kakaru-3/" target="_blank"><em>Kakaru 3</em></a></p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">Shite Re-enters</h3>
<p data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">The function of the shite re-enters <em>dan</em> is to re-introduce the shite, now, in his new guise. The Kongō school’s <em>utaibon</em> describes the first act shite as a woman, the second act one as the woman’s spirit, the difference between the two made visible by the change of <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Shite1" target="_blank">costume</a>.</p>

<p data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">The <em>dan</em> is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and brings the first definitive move towards congruency, thus initiating the ascending curve of the Intermedia Index that will peak with the instrumental dance.
Although the first <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence is still non-congruent, it expands the overall texture with an <em>einori</em> <time datetime='00:40:56.000' title='00:40:56'>chant</time> for one voice and jiutai, accompanied by a non-congruent nohkan’s part and the two hand-percussion instruments already in strict rhythmic setting. It is followed by two congruent chants, both set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments still in strict rhythmic setting. The <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'>first</time> one is sung by the shite, the  <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'>second</time> one by the jiutai. </p>

<p data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">The rapid development of the <em>dan’s</em> musical texture is counterbalanced by the absence of any dance movements. Yet, the staging increases the visual impact in two steps.  Firstly, the shite’s entrance is in voice only. The actor 'appears' by delivering the <em>issei</em>-chant from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em> draped in a violet cloth. This creates great mystery and builds anticipation. Being first heard but not seen is also a beautiful echo of the shite's similar entrance in the first act. Second, it is about half-way in the <em>ageuta</em>, when the drape around the <em>tsukurimono</em> is slowly removed, that the spirit's visual identity is finally revealed.</p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="18">Dialogue</h3>

<p data-highlight-shodans="18">While the Dialogue <em>dan</em> in Act I was setting the play’s premise, this <em>dan</em> serves an introduction to the climax of the play. It creates a context and reason for the shite to dance. </p>

<p data-highlight-shodans="18">The <em>dan</em> consists of only one <em>shōdan</em>, the  <em>rongi</em>. It is a congruent <time datetime='00:47:15.000' title='00:47:15'>sung dialogue</time> performed by the shite and the jiutai. Its poetic text is set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the full <em>hayashi</em> with the percussion in strict setting, and a non-congruent nohkan. Set for two voices instead of one, as in the preceding two chants, this <em>shōdan</em> continues to push upward the Intermedia Index. Although  the performance of <em>kata</em> is rather limited – the shite remains seated for almost the entire time – it is in this <em>shōdan</em>, that the shite walks out from behind the lattice, the <em>hashitomi</em> and asserts new presence on the stage.</p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="19,20">Shite Performs</h3>

<p data-highlight-shodans="19,20">The play's Intermedia Index climaxes in this <em>dan</em>. It is composed of two <em>shōdan</em>, each one a highlight in its own right. </p>
<p data-highlight-shodans="19">
  It starts with the <em>Kuse</em>, the first <time datetime='00:51:58.000' title='00:51:58'> dance-to-text </time> <em>shōdan</em>  of the play. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> is illustrated with various mimetic <em>kata</em>. It is accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting, and a non-congruent nohkan part. </p>

<p data-highlight-shodans="20">Next, the <em>Jonomai</em>, is a congruent <time datetime='01:01:31.000' title='01:01:31'> instrumental dance </time>, where the two-hand percussion instruments maintain their strict rhythmic setting and, for the first and only time in the play, we hear a congruent nohkan part. Following a <em>shōdan</em> that directly correlated text and mimetic dance, this one features pure dance in its full poetic beauty. </p>

<h3 data-highlight-shodans="21,22">Shite Exits</h3>

<p data-highlight-shodans="21,22">The final <em>dan</em> consists of two <em>shōdan</em>. The first, the <em>Waka</em>, is a momentary respite before the final <em>Kiri</em>, which concludes the play with the second highest Intermedia Index. </p>

<p data-highlight-shodans="21">The absence of dance and nohkan in the <em>Waka</em>, both of which for the previous 15 minutes carried the <em>jonomai</em>, is noticeable. The singing drops back to non-congruent <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>chant</time> but text is poetic and delivered by the shite standing in the central Square 9 with accompaniment of the two hand-percussion in strict rhythm. Sufficient tension is maintained to lead smoothly to the final climax.</p>

<p data-highlight-shodans="22">The <em>Kiri</em> brings back movement as <time datetime='01:18:15.000' title='01:18:15'>dance-to-text</time> that uses powerful central square and front of the stage. The poetic text is sung by the jiutai and the shite accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. In the final moments, the nohkan returns with a closing pattern. The intermedia spectacle ends at full force and then dissolves when during dramatically slowing music the audience sees the shite disappear behind the <em>hashitomi</em>.</p>
