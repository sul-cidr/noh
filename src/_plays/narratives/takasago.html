          <p>
            First act: During the Engi period (901-923) under the reign of
            Emperor Daigo, Tomonari, a Shinto priest of Aso Shrine in Kyushu,
            accompanied by two attendants, stops at Takasago-no-ura, in Harima
            Province, where they meet an immaculate old couple, who are sweeping
            up the needles under a pine tree. Tomonari asks the couple to tell
            him the tale associated with the pine.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interlude: A local villager in a conversation with the priest tells
            the story of the Twin Pines. We learn that the deities of Takasago
            and Sumiyoshi are a couple. When visiting, they are said to meet in
            the shade of the two pines, their gathering having continued since
            time immemorial. Another legend alleges that the two deities planted
            these two pine trees, with a pledge that they would protect the two
            sites for billions of years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second Act: As Tomonari and his attendants arrive at the beach in
            Sumiyoshi, the Sumiyoshi Deity appears before them, and dances to
            expel demons, celebrate the longevity of the emperor and people and
            the peace of this world.

            The

            <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank"><em>Shōdan</em> Map</a>

            under the video represents the play’s intermedia form. It also shows
            that the play is composed of two acts, and that the first one
            contains thirteen shōdan, while the second act has eight.
          </p>

          <p>
            The background color grouping the blocks shows that most

            <em>shōdan</em> are bound into <em>dan</em>. Act I has four

            <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Dialogue, Shite Performs, and Shite
            Exits; Act II also has four: Waki Waits, Shite Re-enters, Shite
            Performs, and Shite Exits. Bringing the cursor over a

            <em>shōdan</em> identifies the <em>dan</em> to which it belongs.
          </p>

          <p>
            A comparison between the duration of the two acts shows that the
            first one is about twice as long as the second, suggesting that the
            setting-up of the plot in the first act is more elaborate than the
            second-act development.
          </p>

          <p>
            The height of the blocks shows the development of the play’s

            <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank">Index of Intermedia</a> (IoI). The
            different heights demonstrate that the development is not linear but
            comes in waves. We have identified three kinds of waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. In the first act, each

            <em>dan’s</em> IoI forms a wave leading to a peak closer to its end,
            suggesting that the relationship between the media complexifies as
            the <em>dan</em> is unfolding. For example, the First act’s Waki
            Enters is composed on five <em>shōdan</em>, whose index increases
            exponentially towards the third one. Then, the IoI peaks during the
            last of the Dialogue's two <em>shōdan</em>. It is during the third
            and last <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite Performs that the IoI peaks,
            while in the Shite Exits it peaks on the second out of three
            <em>shōdan</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second: the rising wave across an act. The way the IoI transforms
            over each act differs substantially. The first act counts four
            waves, whereas there is only one in the second act, as the IoI of
            subsequent <em>dan</em> increases until the instrumental dance in
            the Shite Performs <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual
            setting-up of the plot in the first act, followed by a sustained and
            steady development in the second one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The IoI is at its
            lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its four highest peaks
            create a wave that culminates in the third <em>dan</em>. Because the
            play’s premise is already set, the IoI at the beginning of Act II is
            higher than it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower than Act I
            's highest IoI. However, it does not take long for the IoI to
            recuperate the lost ground and further exceed the first act’s peak,
            when reaching the highest IoI with the instrumental dance.

    <h2>Act I</h2>

    <h3>Waki Enters</h3>
    <p>
        Composed of six modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the function of this section (<em>dan</em>) is to set up the play’s premise and provide a reason for the shite to appear. Although this role is often assigned to the secondary actor, the waki, in Takasago’s case, this process is shared between the wakizure who enters next to the waki.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>dan</em>’s overall Intermedia Index is low since three out of the six <em>shōdan</em> include unaccompanied prose. The <em>dan</em> starts with the unique entrance music played exclusively by one percussion and nohkan. The waki enters on the stage and performs ritualistic movement on Square 9. The two wakizures, following the waki, stay at the back of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        The waki delivers the first and second unmetered monologue on Square 8. Over the short instrumental accompaniment, the waki moves from Square 8 to 5, while the wakizure moves from the back to Squares 2 and 3. Taking this formation, they sing two congruent songs, Shidai-Chant and Michiyuki, both set in <em>hiranori</em>. The first song, Shidai-Chant, marks the first entrance of the jiutai, but they sing in a low voice to create a contrast with the waki and wakizure’s vigorous voices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those songs are accompanied by two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. In Michiyuki, the waki, standing on Square 5, walks forward on the same Square. Finally, the <em>dan</em> closes with a short dialogue, Tsuki-zerifu, in which the waki speaks and a wakizure gives a short reply.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Shite Enters</h3>
    <p>
        In most plays, the entrance of the shite on the stage in act 1 is accompanied by Issei Music in which two percussions play in strict setting and nohkan is non-congruent. In Takasago, a variation, Shin no Issei Music, accompanies the entrance of actors. The shitezure stops at the first pine on the bridge, then the shite on the first pine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shin no Issei Chant is also a variation of Issei chant in which two percussions play in strict setting. Nokan does not play in Standard Issei Chant, but here nokan adds a non-congruent short passage to the song. The shite and shitezure stay on the bridge while they sing Issei Chant. On the short instrumental introduction, the shitezure moves from pine one to Square 9 and the shite from pine three to Square 1. Facing forward, they start to sing sashi 1, which is sung in sashi nori mode, a type of incongruent chanting. The percussions accompany the song in flexible setting, with nokan adding non-congruent passages at the end of this section. When they sing in unison, they move to face each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Standing in the same position, they sing two congruent songs, Sageuta and Ageuta, both set in <em>hiranori</em>. In Sageuta, percussion is in a strict setting, with no nokan played. In Ageuta, nokan plays a non-congruent melody over the chanting while percussion plays in strict setting. In the latter half of Ageuta, the shite moves from Square 1 to 8, while the shitezure moves from 9 to 2 to prepare for the next dan.

    <h3>Dialogue</h3>
    <p>
        The function of the Dialogue <em>dan</em> in Takasago is to reveal the characters of shite and shitezure and the story associated with the place names. It is spread over four <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with Mondō, an unmetered and unaccompanied exchange in prose between actors. It is followed by Kakeai, the exchange of non-congruent chant between characters accompanied by two percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s play. The formation on stage does not change: the shite is on 8, shitezure on 2, and the waki on 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kakeai is followed by Ageuta 2, set in <em>hiranori</em>, delivered by the jiutai, accompanied by two hand percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part. The shitezure moves to 7 and the waki to the right of the stage to take a seat at their regular place while the shite starts to dance, enlarging his space to a stronger position at 4. Then he returns to Square 1 to restart the next dan. Following Dialogue is a short bridge to the next Dan. The percussion is performed in flexible setting so as not to disturb the words in the dialogue.

    <h3>Shite Performs</h3>
    <p>
        The first act’s Shite Performs <em>dan</em> develops the storytelling by the shite and establishes the shite's character. It is the highlight of Act I. In Takasago's case, it consists of three <em>shōdan</em>, the last of which is the kuse. In this <em>dan</em>, the Intermedia Index reaches the highest level in Act I, matching that of the succeeding <em>dan</em> SHITE EXITS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>dan</em> starts with a dynamic non-congruent chant sung by the jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. The next <em>shōdan</em> lowers the overall level of congruency even more with another non-congruent chant sung by the shite and jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This is in clear contrast with the dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> that follows. This is where the kernel of the plot is presented and is the first act’s point of focus. The shite and jiutai sing the poetic text, set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the percussion instruments set in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan’s part, which substantially raises the play's overall level of congruency. As a storyteller, the shite keeps sitting at Square 9, but in the final part of kuse, he stands up and dances, using the whole stage.

    </p>

    <h3>Shite Exits</h3>
    <p>
        The function of the Shite Exits <em>dan</em> is to facilitate the shite’s exit while providing a reason for his return in Act II. It only contains a <em>shōdan</em>, rongi, a congruent chant by two parts: the shite sitting on Square 9 and the jiutai. The <em>rongi</em> consists of poetic text, set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting. The addition of a short choreography in the final jiutai part contributes to an increase in the Intermedia Index.

          or short performance between the acts, traditionally performed by a
          kyōgen actor, has a dual function. First, it allows time for the shite
          to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character;
          second, it helps clarify the story. The kyōgen is usually unmasked and
          engaged in a discussion with the waki, but in Kokaji the kyōgen is
          masked, since he personifies a deity from a lower-ranked shrine. He
          also addresses the audience since the waki has left the stage for a
          change of costume.

          The function of the Waki Waits <em>dan</em> is to restart the
          narrative and set the scene for the shite’s re-entrance. Kokaji’s Waki
          Waits <em>dan</em> is composed of two <em>shōdan</em>. It opens up
          with a

          set in <em>ōnori </em>, accompanied by the three percussion
          instruments set in strict rhythm. The jiutai sings it following a
          one-line introduction sang by the waki.

          It continues to raise the Intermedia Index with the two-hand

          energetic <em>kata</em>, which he performs on the bridge.

          The Intermedia Index climaxes in the second act Shite Performs

          <time datetime="00:54:14.000" title="00:54:14">third</time> congruent
          chants set in <em>ōnori</em>. Accompanied by the percussion trio set
          in strict rhythm, the first one also includes a non-congruent nohkan
          part. The jiutai who sings the first chant is joined by the shite in
          the second one.

          The second act’s Shite Exits <em>dan</em> includes two

          the waki and shite, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments

          Index, and serves as a respite from congruency, so that its return

          the last <em>shōdan</em> is set in

          <em>chūnori</em> with a percussion part in strict rhythm and a
          non-congruent nohkan part.
