            Something that summarizes the play in one sentence pointing out to
            the celebratory quality and principle themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            First act: During the Engi period (901-923) under the reign of
            Emperor Daigo, Tomonari, a Shinto priest of Aso Shrine in Kyushu,
            accompanied by two attendants, stops at Takasago-no-ura, in Harima
            Province, where they meet an immaculate old couple, who are sweeping
            up the needles under a pine tree. Tomonari asks the couple to tell
            him the tale associated with the pine.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interlude: A local villager in a conversation with the priest tells
            the story of the Twin Pines. We learn that the deities of Takasago
            and Sumiyoshi are a couple. When visiting, they are said to meet in
            the shade of the two pines, their gathering having continued since
            time immemorial. Another legend alleges that the two deities planted
            these two pine trees, Takasago in Harima province (today part of
            Hyogo prefecture) and Suminoe in Settsu Province (today part of
            Osaka prefecture), with a pledge that they would protect the two
            sites for billions of years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second Act: As Tomonari and his attendants arrive at the beach in
            Sumiyoshi, the Sumiyoshi Deity appears before them, and dances to
            expel demons, celebrate the longevity of the emperor and people and
            the peace of this world.

          <p>
            The
            <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank"><em>Shōdan</em> Map</a>
            under the video represents the play’s intermedia form. It also shows
            that the play is composed of two acts, and that the first one
            contains nineteen <em>shōdan</em>, while the second act has seven.
          </p>
          <p>
            The background color grouping the blocks shows that most
            <em>shōdan</em> are bound into <em>dan</em>. Act I has five
            <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Shite Enters, Dialogue, Shite Performs,
            and Shite Exits; Act II has four: Waki Waits, Shite Re-enters, Shite
            Performs, and Shite Exits. Bringing the cursor over a
            <em>shōdan</em> identifies the <em>dan</em> to which it belongs.
          </p>
          <p>
            First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. In the first act, each
            <em>dan’s</em> IoI forms a wave leading to a peak closer to its end,
            suggesting that the relationship between the media becomes more
            complex as the <em>dan</em> is unfolding. For example, the first
            act’s Waki Enters is composed of six <em>shōdan</em>, whose index
            increases exponentially towards the fourth and fifth ones. Then, the
            IoI peaks during the last of Shite Enters’ five <em>shōdan</em> and
            at the third of the Dialogue's four <em>shōdan</em>. It is during
            the third and last <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite Performs that the
            IoI peaks. The Shite Exits has only one <em>shōdan</em> with an IoI
            slightly lower than the Shite Perform’s highest one, thus closing
            the Act with its second-highest IoI.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second: the rising wave across an act. The way the IoI transforms
            over each act differs substantially. The first act counts four
            waves, whereas there is only one in the second act, as the IoI of
            subsequent <em>dan</em>, following the Machiutai of the Waki Waits
            <em>dan</em>, increases until the instrumental dance in the Shite
            Performs <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual setting-up of
            the plot in the first act, followed by a sustained and steady
            development in the second one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The IoI is at its
            lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its four highest peaks
            create a wave that culminates in the fourth and fifth <em>dan</em>.
            Because the play’s premise is already set, the IoI at the beginning
            of Act II is higher than it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower
            than Act I's highest IoI. However, it does not take long for the IoI
            to recover the lost ground and further exceed the first act’s peak,
            when reaching the highest IoI with the instrumental dance.

        <h2>Act I</h2>

        <h3>Waki Enters</h3>
        <p>
          Composed of six modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the function of this
          section (<em>dan</em>) is to set up the play’s premise and provide a
          reason for the shite to appear. Although this role is often assigned
          to the secondary actor, the waki, in Takasago’s case, this process is
          shared between the wakizure who enters next to the waki.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>dan</em>’s overall Intermedia Index is low since three out of
          the six <em>shōdan</em> include unaccompanied prose. The
          <em>dan</em> starts with the unique entrance music played exclusively
          by one percussion and nohkan. The waki enters on the stage and
          performs ritualistic movement on Square 9. The two wakizures,
          following the waki, stay at the back of the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The waki delivers the first and second unmetered monologue on Square
          8. Over the short instrumental accompaniment, the waki moves from
          Square 8 to 5, while the wakizure moves from the back to Squares 2 and
          3. Taking this formation, they sing two congruent songs, Shidai-Chant
          and Michiyuki, both set in <em>hiranori</em>. The first song,
          Shidai-Chant, marks the first entrance of the jiutai, but they sing in
          a low voice to create a contrast with the waki and wakizure’s vigorous
          voices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those songs are accompanied by two hand-percussion instruments in
          strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. In
          Michiyuki, the waki, standing on Square 5, walks forward on the same
          Square. Finally, the <em>dan</em> closes with a short dialogue,
          Tsuki-zerifu, in which the waki speaks and a wakizure gives a short
          reply.
        </p>

        <h3>Shite Enters</h3>
        <p>
          In most plays, the entrance of the shite on the stage in act 1 is
          accompanied by Issei Music in which two percussions play in strict
          setting and nohkan is non-congruent. In Takasago, a variation, Shin no
          Issei Music, accompanies the entrance of actors. The shitezure stops
          at the first pine on the bridge, then the shite on the first pine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shin no Issei Chant is also a variation of Issei chant in which two
          percussions play in strict setting. Nokan does not play in Standard
          Issei Chant, but here nokan adds a non-congruent short passage to the
          song. The shite and shitezure stay on the bridge while they sing Issei
          Chant. On the short instrumental introduction, the shitezure moves
          from pine one to Square 9 and the shite from pine three to Square 1.
          Facing forward, they start to sing sashi 1, which is sung in sashi
          nori mode, a type of incongruent chanting. The percussions accompany
          the song in flexible setting, with nokan adding non-congruent passages
          at the end of this section. When they sing in unison, they move to
          face each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing in the same position, they sing two congruent songs, Sageuta
          and Ageuta, both set in <em>hiranori</em>. In Sageuta, percussion is
          in a strict setting, with no nokan played. In Ageuta, nokan plays a
          non-congruent melody over the chanting while percussion plays in
          strict setting. In the latter half of Ageuta, the shite moves from
          Square 1 to 8, while the shitezure moves from 9 to 2 to prepare for
          the next dan.

        <h3>Dialogue</h3>
        <p>
          The function of the Dialogue <em>dan</em> in Takasago is to reveal the
          characters of shite and shitezure and the story associated with the
          place names. It is spread over four <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with
          Mondō, an unmetered and unaccompanied exchange in prose between
          actors. It is followed by Kakeai, the exchange of non-congruent chant
          between characters accompanied by two percussion instruments in
          flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s play. The
          formation on stage does not change: the shite is on 8, shitezure on 2,
          and the waki on 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kakeai is followed by Ageuta 2, set in <em>hiranori</em>, delivered by
          the jiutai, accompanied by two hand percussion instruments in strict
          rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part. The shitezure
          moves to 7 and the waki to the right of the stage to take a seat at
          their regular place while the shite starts to dance, enlarging his
          space to a stronger position at 4. Then he returns to Square 1 to
          restart the next dan. Following Dialogue is a short bridge to the next
          Dan. The percussion is performed in flexible setting so as not to
          disturb the words in the dialogue.

        <h3>Shite Performs</h3>
        <p>
          The first act’s Shite Performs <em>dan</em> develops the storytelling
          by the shite and establishes the shite's character. It is the
          highlight of Act I. In Takasago's case, it consists of three
          <em>shōdan</em>, the last of which is the kuse. In this <em>dan</em>,
          the Intermedia Index reaches the highest level in Act I, matching that
          of the succeeding <em>dan</em> SHITE EXITS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>dan</em> starts with a dynamic non-congruent chant sung by the
          jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a
          non-congruent nohkan’s part. The next <em>shōdan</em> lowers the
          overall level of congruency even more with another non-congruent chant
          sung by the shite and jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in
          flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This is
          in clear contrast with the dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> that follows.
          This is where the kernel of the plot is presented and is the first
          act’s point of focus. The shite and jiutai sing the poetic text, set
          in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the percussion instruments set in
          strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan’s part, which substantially
          raises the play's overall level of congruency. As a storyteller, the
          shite keeps sitting at Square 9, but in the final part of kuse, he
          stands up and dances, using the whole stage.
        </p>

        <h3>Shite Exits</h3>
        <p>
          The function of the Shite Exits <em>dan</em> is to facilitate the
          shite’s exit while providing a reason for his return in Act II. It
          only contains a <em>shōdan</em>, rongi, a congruent chant by two
          parts: the shite sitting on Square 9 and the jiutai. The
          <em>rongi</em> consists of poetic text, set in <em>hiranori</em>,
          accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting. The addition
          of a short choreography in the final jiutai part contributes to an
          increase in the Intermedia Index.

        <h2>Interlude</h2>
        <p>
          Fitting with its typical function and form, the kyōgen Interlude in
          Takasago features an un-masked kyōgen actor as a villager in dialogue
          with the priest. For most of the shōdan they kneel on the floor and
          remain almost motionless. We hear a 'plain-spoken' story of Takasago,
          which gives the essential background of the play's main character.

        <h3>Waki Waits</h3>
        <p>
          The Waki Waits dan restarts the narration and sets the groundwork for
          the shite to re-enter. In Takasago, the dan is composed of a single
          shōdan, called Machiutai. Michiyuki is a congruent song accompanied by
          the two hand-percussion instruments in strict setting, nokan in
          non-congruent. Because of the participation of all the parts, overall
          Intermedia Index stays higher than the following instrumental music,
          dewa in Shite Re-enters.

        <h3>Shite Re-enters</h3>
        <p>
          The Shite Re-enters section includes only one shōdan, a dynamic
          entrance music with the participation of the third percussion taiko.
          Although its Intermedia Index stays lower than the preceding one, the
          two-hand percussion instruments and taiko in strict rhythmic setting
          and the noncongruent nohkan part in the play introduce the shite’s
          energetic entrance on stage at pine one.

        <h3>Dialogue</h3>
        <p>There is no Dialogue section in Takasago’s second act.</p>

        <h3>Shite Performs</h3>
        <p>
          The Intermedia Index climaxes in the second act Shite Performs dan. It
          is composed of three shōdan, Sashi 2, Jōnoei, Issei and Kamimai. Sashi
          2, different from Sashi 1, is performed in a very energetic way, with
          the three percussions in strict setting and the nokan non-congruent.
          The shite starts to dance on the bridge at pine 3. Jōnoei and
          following Issei are continuously performed in a very energetic way,
          with the three percussions in strict setting, but no nokan play. The
          shite moves from the bridge to Square 1 in Jōnoei and dances on Square
          1 and 2. In the following Issei part, the shite keeps dancing,
          gradually enlarging his dance space to the whole stage. Kamimai holds
          the highest Intermedia level, having the shite’s dance accompanied by
          nokan congruent and percussion in strict setting. The addition of
          taiko strokes and kakegoe, along with its highest tempo of all the
          performances of Noh, is worth giving the highest Intermedia level.

        <h3>Shite Exits</h3>
        <p>
          The second act’s Shite Exits dan includes one shōdan, Rongi. It starts
          with a dialogic chanting between the jiutai and the shite, accompanied
          by the two hand-percussion instruments in strict setting. This Rongi
          is usually set in hiranori, but this rongi includes several lines that
          are identical to chūnori. Throughout this part, the shite dances
          energetically using the whole stage. Nokan adds a non-congruent
          passage at the end of this part.
