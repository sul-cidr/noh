  <h2>Intermedia Structure</h2>
  <p>The figure below the video summarizes the form of Kokaji. Each of the play's twenty sections is represented with a column whose width is proportional to its duration. The Y axis displays the twenty-nine levels of energy as defined in the
<a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/noh/intermedia-structure.html">
Introduction to the Intermedia Structure
</a> .

Clicking on a column will move the video to the beginning of that section and update information in the table beside the figure, showing the section's name (shōdan) and status of its components. The section’s name in the table is linked to a page with its analysis.

</p>
  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about twice the duration of the second, which creates a sense of acceleration of the form as a whole. It shows also that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but rather comes in waves. The overall roller coaster shape of the figure counts four peaks, with the first one being the lowest and the third one the highest.</p>

  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <p>After having had a dream about a powerful sword, the 11th century emperor Ichijō sends an envoy to the swordsmith Kokaji Munechika requesting that he forges that sword. Munechika, who does not have an assistant with the proper skills to help him create that sword, goes to the Inari shrine to pray. There a boy comes to him and tells him that help is coming. Munechika goes back home where the deity from the Inari shrine appears and helps him forge the requested sword.</p>

  <h2>Act I</h2>
<h3>Waki’s entrance</h3>
  <p>
The waki's entrance part is spread over 4 sections (<em>shōdan</em>). It is the <time datetime='00:03:00.000' title='00:03:00'>waki-tsure</time> who first enters the stage without any accompaniment. After reaching Square 1, he delivers a <em><time datetime='00:03:55.000' title='00:03:55'>nanori</time></em>, an intoned prose announcement of his identity. A <em><time datetime='00:05:15.000' title='00:05:15'>mondō</time></em>, that is a dialogue in prose between the waki-tsure and the waki precedes an <em><time datetime='00:08:43.000' title='00:08:43'>ageuta</time></em>, a chant between the waki and jiutai, set in <em>hiranori</em> with congruent accompaniment by the percussion with a non-congruent <em>nohkan's</em> part. The waki's entrance part of the play is concluded with a short <time datetime='00:10:46.000' title='00:10:46'>dialogue</time> between the waki-sture and the waki, followed by a <time datetime='00:11:20.000' title='00:11:20'>monologue</time> delivered by the waki.
</p><p>
The  transformation of textures of these first five sections (<em>shōdan</em>)  moves in an exponential fashion from a level 3 to 17 before dropping back to 3.
</p>

<h3>Shite’s entrance</h3>
<p>
The shite enters with the unexpected call from the distance: <em><time datetime='00:12:18.000' title='00:12:18'>yobikake</time></em>. It comes unaccompanied since any entrance music would have spoiled its effect.
</p>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<p>
The <em><time datetime='00:12:53.000' title='00:12:53'>mondō</time></em>, a dialogue in prose opens the first act's third part, followed by an <em><time datetime='00:14:58.000' title='00:14:58'>ageuta</time></em> performed by the jiutai, a chant set in <em>hiranori</em> with congruent accompaniment by the percussion with a non-congruent <em>nohkan's</em> part.
</p><p>
The  transformation of textures of these two sections (<em>shōdan</em>) jumps from a level 4 to 17.
</p>

<h3>The shite performs</h3>
<p>
This sequence of sections is composed of three sections (<em>shōdan</em>). It starts with a non-congruent chant: <em><time datetime='00:16:54.000' title='00:16:54'>kuri</time></em> sung by the jiutai, leading to a recitative: <em><time datetime='00:17:55.000' title='00:17:55'>sashi</time></em> sung by the shite and jiutai. The <em><time datetime='00:19:53.000' title='00:19:53'>iguse</time></em> that follows is the first act’s point of focus. This is where the plot kernel is given. Sung by the shite and jiutai, it is set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by a congruent percussion part and a non-congruent <em>nohkan</em> part. It is divided up into three parts, and although the shite is seated for the first two, he stands up and dances during the last one.
</p><p>
The transformation of textures of these three sections (<em>shōdan</em>)  moves in an exponential fashion from a level 14 to 25.
</p>

<h3>Shite exits</h3>
<p>
The shite's exit is preceded by a <em><time datetime='00:29:07.000' title='00:29:07'>kakei</time></em>, a dialogue in prose between the shite and waki whose last line is sung rather than spoken, followed by an <em><time datetime='00:30:05.000' title='00:30:05'>ageuta</time></em>, a chant set in <em>hiranori</em> performed by the jiutai with a congruent accompaniment by the percussion with a non-congruent <em>nohkan's</em> part. The first part is then concluded with a <em><time datetime='00:31:20.000' title='00:31:20'>raijo</time></em>, performed by the three percussionists and the <em>nohkan</em> player. The music accompanies the exiting shite and subsequently the entering aikyōgen.
</p><p>
The transformation of textures of these three sections (<em>shōdan</em>) moves from a level 9 to 22 and finally to 12.</p>

  <h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>
The <em><time datetime='00:34:13.000' title='00:34:13'>nakairi</time></em> or short performance between the acts performed traditionally by a kyōgen actor has a dual function: first, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; second, it helps clarify the story. Here, an aikyōgen actor acting  as a well informed villager summarizes the first act before providing context for the second. The aikyōgen is usually unmasked and engaged in a discussion with the waki. The situation in Kokaji is different. The aikyōgen is masked because.... and he addresses the audience since the waki has also left the stage for a change of costume.

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2>Act II</h2>
  <h3>Waki waits</h3>
<p>
The second act opens up with the waki performing a <em><time datetime='00:45:19.000' title='00:45:19'>notto</time></em>, a non-congruent chant sung by the waki in <em>sashinori</em> style, accompanied by a steady percussion beat. It is followed by a <em><time datetime='00:48:41.000' title='00:48:41'>noriji</time></em>, set in <em>ōnori</em> accompanied by a congruent percussion part. It is introduced by the waki and sung by the jiutai.</p>
<p>
The transformation of textures of these two sections (<em>shōdan</em>) moves from a level 14 to 16.
</p>


<h3>Shite re-enters</h3>
<p>
The shite's re-entrance is accompanied by the vary dynamic <em><time datetime='00:51:07.000' title='00:51:07'>hayafue</time></em>, an entrance music with congruent percussion and <em>nohkan</em> parts.  Its hierarchical level is 21.</p>



<h3>Shite performs</h3>
<p>
The pure dance <em><time datetime='00:53:16.000' title='00:53:16'>maibataraki</time></em> is the highlight of the play. It is flanked on each side by play's second <em><time datetime='00:52:31.000' title='00:52:31'>noriji</time></em>, and third <em><time datetime='00:54:15.000' title='00:54:15'>noriji</time></em>. Set in <em>ōnori</em> with a congruent percussion part, the first one of the two also includes a non-congruent <em>nohkan</em> part. The jiutai sings the first one, joined by the shite for the singing of the second one.</p>
<p>
The  transformation of textures of these three sections (<em>shōdan</em>) moves from 27 to 29 and down to 24.
</p>


<h3>Conclusion: <em>kiri</em></h3>
<p>
The last sequence of two sections essentially maintains the hierarchical level reached by the pure dance. It starts with the short spoken dialogue <em><time datetime='00:56:10.000' title='00:56:10'>kakeai</time></em>  between the waki and shite, accompanied by a non-congruent percussion part, followed by the <em><time datetime='00:56:18.000' title='00:56:18'>kiri</time></em>, which is set in <em>chūnori</em> with a congruent percussion and a non-congruent <em>nohkan</em> parts, sung by the shite and jiutai.</p>
<p>
The transformation of textures of these two sections (<em>shōdan</em>) moves from a level 9 to 28.</p>
