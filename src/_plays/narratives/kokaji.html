    <div>
      <p> First act: After receiving an oracle in a dream about a powerful sword, the 11th century emperor Ichijō sends an envoy to the swordsmith Kokaji Munechika requesting that he forges it. Munechika, who does not have an assistant with the proper skills to help him create the sword, goes to the Inari shrine to pray. There a boy appears and tells him that help is coming. </p>

      <p>Interlude: A god from a subsidiary shrine appears. He summarizes the events that took place in the first half of the play, and concludes by an assurance that prayers will be answered.</p>

      <p>Second act: Munechika returns to his home and prepares for the ceremonial forging of the sword. With his prayers, the deity Inari appears in its form as a fox and helps him forge the requested sword. It is offered to the envoy and the deity disappears.</p>

  <h3 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Intermedia Form</h3>

  <div>
    <p>The <a href="/form/#shodanmap" target="_blank"><em>Shōdan</em> Map</a> under the video represents the play’s intermedia form. It also shows that the play is composed of two acts, and that the first one counts thirteen <em>shōdan</em>, against eight for the second act. </p>

    <p>The color of the blocks shows that most <em>shōdan</em> are bound into <em>dan</em>. Act I has four <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Dialogue, Shite Performs, and Shite Exits; whereas Act II has four: Waki Waits, Shite Re-enters, Shite Performs, and Shite Exits. Bringing the cursor over a <em>shōdan</em> identifies the <em>dan</em> it belongs to. </p>

    <p>A comparison between the duration of the two acts shows that the first one is about twice as long as the second, suggesting that the setting-up of the plot in the first act is more elaborate than the second-act development. </p>

    <p>The height of the blocks shows the development of the play’s Intermedia Texture Index (ITI). The fluctuating heights demonstrate that the development is not linear but comes in waves. We have identified three kinds of waves: </p>

    <p>First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. In the first act, each <em>dan’s</em> ITI forms a wave leading to a peak closer to its end, suggesting that the relationship between the media complexifies as the <em>dan</em> is unfolding. For example, the First act’s Waki enters is composed on five <em>shōdan</em>, whose index increases exponentially towards its third one. In the Dialogue’s two <em>shōdan</em>, the peak is on the last one. It is also on the third and last <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite performs that its ITI peaks, while it is on the second out of three, that it peaks in the Shite exits. </p>

    <p>Second: the rising wave across an act. The transformation of the ITI of each act differs substantially. The first act counts four waves, whereas there is only one in the second act, as the ITI of subsequent <em>dan</em> keeps increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite performs <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual setting-up of the plot in the first act, followed by a sustained and steady development in the second one. </p>

    <p>Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The ITI is at its lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its four highest peaks create a wave that culminates in the third <em>dan</em>. The play’s premise being already set, the ITI at the beginning of Act II is higher than it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower than Act I highest ITI. But it does not take long for the ITI to recuperate the lost ground and further exceed the first act’s peak when reaching the highest ITI with the instrumental dance. </p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15">Act I</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7">Waki Enters</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7">Composed of five modules (<em>shōdan</em>), the function of this section (<em>dan</em>) is to set up the play’s premise and provide a reason for the shite to appear. Although, this task is often assigned to the secondary actor the waki, in Kokaji’s case, this process is shared between the wakizure who enters first, and the waki. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5,6,7">The <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low since four out of the five <em>shōdan</em> are unaccompanied prose. The first one is an unmetered <time datetime='00:03:55.000' title='00:03:55'>monologue</time> delivered by the wakizure standing on Square 1. The second one is  an unmetered <time datetime='00:05:15.000' title='00:05:15'>dialogue</time> uttered from the bridge. This is followed by a congruent <time datetime='00:08:42.000' title='00:08:42'>song</time> set in <em>hiranori</em>  that marks the first entrance of the jiutai and of the two hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. The two actors enter the main stage as the jiutai delivers the chant. If the wakizure was the leader in the <em>dan’s</em> first half, the waki takes over in the second half.
  It starts with a very short <time datetime='00:10:46.000' title='00:10:46'>exchange</time> between the wakizure kneeling at Square 5, and the waki kneeling at Square 9.
  Finally, the <em>dan</em> closes with a <time datetime='00:11:00.000' title='00:11:00'>soliloquy</time> presented by the waki standing at Square 1. </p>

  </p>

  <h3 >Shite Enters</h3>
  <p>There is no Shite enters <em>dan</em> in Kokaji’s first act. To make the appeaarance of the protagonist mysterious and unanticipated it is not introduced by particular entrance music nor chant but instead, it happens in the following <em>dan</em>through dialogue with waki. </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="8,9">Dialogue</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="8,9">The function of the Dialogue <em>dan</em> is to set the play’s premise.  It is spread over two <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with an unmetered and unaccompanied <time datetime='00:12:18.000' title='00:12:18'>exchange</time> in prose between the shite and waki, a dialogue whose low Intermedia Index is not accounting for its element of surprise. It is followed by the second congruent <time datetime='00:14:58.000' title='00:14:58'>chant</time> of the play. Set in <em>hiranori</em>, it is delivered by the jiutai, accompanied by the two-hand percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan's part. </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="10,11,12">Shite Performs</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="10,11,12">The first act’s Shite performs <em>dan</em> provides the shite with the opportunity to establish his character.  It is the highlight of Act I, with the play’s first dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em>, a <em>kuse-mai</em>. In Kokaji's case, it is a sequence of three <em>shōdan</em>, the last of which is the <em>kuse</em> proper. The return to non-congruent singing at the beginning of the <em>dan</em> brings the Intermedia Index lower than where it ended in the preceding one, but that is before reaching the highest level in Act I. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="10,11,12">The <em>dan</em> starts with a dynamic non-congruent <time datetime='00:16:55.000' title='00:16:55'>chant</time> sung by the jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. The next <em>shōdan</em> further lowers the overall level of congruency with <time datetime='00:17:56.000' title='00:17:56'> another non-congruent chant </time> sung by the shite and jiutai, accompanied by the percussion in flexible rhythmic setting and a non-congruent nohkan’s part. This is in clear contrast with the <time datetime='00:19:54.000' title='00:19:54'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em> that follows.  This is where the plot kernel is given and as such it is the first act’s point of focus. The return of poetic text sung by the shite and jiutai, set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the percussion instruments set in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan’s part, help to substantially raises the play's overall level of congruency. </p>

  </p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="13,14,15">Shite Exits</h3>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="13,14,15">The function of the Shite exits <em>dan’s</em> is to facilitate the shite’s exit, while providing a reason for his return in Act II. It counts three <em>shōdan</em>.  It is the dramatic and energic second <em>shōdan’s</em> that leads to the boy’s exit, but it comes only after he has promised to come back to help Munechika forge the requested sword. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="13">The <em>dan</em> opens with a <time datetime='00:29:07.000' title='00:29:07'>dialogue</time> in prose between the shite and waki whose last line is sung rather than spoken. The return to <em>kotoba</em> with the percussion instruments in flexible setting, and the absence stage movement, drastically reduces the Intermedia index. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="14">It is followed by the first act's third and last congruent <time datetime='00:30:05.000' title='00:30:05'>chant</time>. Its poetic text set in <em>hiranori</em> performed by the jiutai and accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic, and the addition of a short choreography help bring raise the Intermedia Index.  </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="15">The first act is then concluded with an <time datetime='00:31:20.000' title='00:31:20'>exit music</time> that accompanies the shite and waki’s exit, as well as the kyōgen’s entrance. It is performed by the three percussionists and the nohkan player. The rhythmic setting is flexible during the exit of the two protagonists, but becomes strict for the entrance of the kyōgen. </p>

  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="16,17">Interlude</h2>
  <p data-highlight-shodans="16">The <em><time datetime='00:34:49.000' title='00:34:49'>ai-kyōgen</time></em> or short performance between the acts, traditionally performed by a kyōgen actor, has a dual function: first, it allows time for the shite to change mask and costume to transform into the second-act character; second, it helps clarify the story. The kyōgen is usually unmasked and engaged in a discussion with the waki, but the situation is different in Kokaji. First the kyōgen is masked since he personifies a deity from a lower-ranked shrine. Moreover, he addresses the audience since the waki has left the stage for a change of costume.</p>

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2 data-highlight-shodans="18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25">Act II</h2>
  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="18,19">Waki Waits</h3>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="18,19">The function of the Waki waits <em>dan</em> is to restart the narrative and set the scene for the shite’s re-entrance. Kokaji’s Waki waits <em>dan</em> is composed of two <em>shōdan</em>. It opens up with a <time datetime='00:45:14.000' title='00:45:14'>non-congruent chant</time> set in <em>sashinori</em>, accompanied by a steady percussion beat. It is followed by a <time datetime='00:48:30.000' title='00:48:30'>congruent chant</time> set in <em>ōnori </em>, accompanied by the three percussion instruments set in strict rhythm. It is introduced by the waki but sang by the jiutai. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="18,19">The play’s premise being already set, the Intermedia Index at the beginning of Act II is higher than it was at the beginning of Act I. Yet, the return to non-congruency, combined with the smaller instrumentation keeps it in the lower range. This being said, there is an important difference is the transformation of the Intermedia Index in Act II. In the first act, the Intermedia Index of each <em>dan</em> includes a peak followed with a release usually at the beginning of the next <em>dan</em>. Also, the sequence of highest peaks creates a wave that leads to the highest and longest peak of Act I with the <em>kuse</em> in the Shite performs <em>dan</em>. In the second act, there is a single wave, as the Intermedia Index of subsequent <em>dan</em> keeps increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite performs <em>dan</em>, followed by a small release in the following Shite exits <em>dan</em>.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="20">Shite Re-enters</h3>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="20">The Shite re-enters section includes only one <em>shōdan</em>, an extremely dynamic <time datetime='00:51:07.000' title='00:51:07'>entrance music</time>. It continues to raise the Intermedia Index with the two-hand percussion instruments and taiko in strict rhythmic setting and the very first congruent nohkan part in the play accompanying the shite’s energetic <em>kata</em > that he performs on the Bridge. </p>

    <p>There is no Dialogue section in Kokaji’s second act.</p>

  <h3 data-highlight-shodans="21,22,23">Shite Performs</h3>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="21,22,23"> The Intermedia Index climaxes in the second act Shite performs <em>dan</em>. It is composed of three <em>shōdan</em> and its second one, the <time datetime='00:53:18.000' title='00:53:18'>instrumental dance</time>, is the highlight of the play. It is flanked on each side by the play's  <time datetime='00:52:30.000' title='00:52:30'>second</time>, and  <time datetime='00:54:14.000' title='00:54:14'>third</time> congruent chants set in <em>ōnori</em>. Accompanied by the percussion trio set in strict rhythm, the first one also includes a non-congruent nohkan part. The jiutai who sings the first one is joined by the shite in the second one. </p>

  <p data-highlight-shodans="24,25">The second act’s Shite exits <em>dan</em> includes two <em>shōdan</em>. It starts with a short spoken <time datetime='00:56:10.000' title='00:56:10'>dialogue</time> between the waki and shite, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in flexible rhythmic setting. It substantially reduces the Intermedia Index, and serves as a respite from congruency, so that its return with the next <time datetime='00:56:40.000' title='00:56:40'>dance-to-text</time> <em>shōdan</em>, creates a refreshing increase in momentum. Sung by the jiutai and shite, the last <em>shōdan</em> is set in <em>chūnori</em>  with a percussion part in strict rhythm and a non-congruent nohkan part. </p>
