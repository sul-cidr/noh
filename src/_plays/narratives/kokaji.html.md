  <h2>Intermedia Structure</h2>
  <p>The figure below the video summarizes the form of Kokaji. Each of its twenty sections are represented with a column whose width is proportional to their duration. The Y axis displays the twenty hierarchical positions defined in the

Clicking on a column will move the video to the beginning of that section and bring up information in the table beside the figure showing the section's name (shôdan) and status of its components. The section’s name in the table is linked to a page with its analysis.

</p>
  <p>The figure shows that the overall duration of the first act is about twice the duration of the second, which creates a sense of acceleration of the form as a whole. It shows also that the transformation of the play's media components is not linear, but rather comes in waves. The overall roller coaster shape of the figure counts four peaks, with the first one being the lowest and the third one the highest.</p>

  <h3>The Story</h3>
  <p>After having had a dream about a powerful sword, the 11th century emperor Ichijô sends an envoy to the swordsmith Kokaji Munechika requesting that he forges that sword. Munechika, who does not have an assistant with the proper skills to help him create that sword, goes to the Inari shrine to pray. There a boy comes to him and tells him that help is coming. Munechika goes back home where the deity from the Inari shrine appears and helps him forge the requested sword.</p>

  <h2>Act I</h2>
  <h3>Waki’s entrance</h3>
  <p>
The waki’s entance is spread over 4 sections (shôdan). It is the waki-tsure who first enters the stage without any accompaniment. After reaching Square 1, he delivers a nanori, an intoned prose announcement of his identity. A mondô, that is a dialogue in prose between the waki-tsure and the waki precedes an ageuta, a chant between the waki and chorus, set in hiranori with congruent accompaniment by the percussion with a non-congruent nohkan's part. The waki's entrance is concluded with a unnamed spoken section.
</p><p>
The  transformation of textures of these first three sections (shôdan)  moves in an exponential fashion from a level 1 to 16 before dropping to 2.
</p>

<h3>Shite’s entrance</h3>
<p>
The shite enters with the unexpected call from the distance: yobikake. It comes unaccompanied since any entrance music would have spoiled the surpise effect.
</p>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<p>
The mondô, a dialogue in prose opens the first act's third part, followed by an ageuta performed by the chorus, a chant set in hiranori with congruent accompaniment by the percussion with a non-congruent nohkan's part.
</p><p>
The  transformation of textures of these two sections (shôdan) jumps from a level 2 to 15.
</p>

<h3>The shite performs</h3>
<p>
This sequence of sections is composed of three sections (shôdan). It starts with a non-congruent chant: kuri sung by the chorus, leading to a recitative: sashi sung by the shite and chorus. The iguse that follows is the first act’s point of focus. This is where the plot kernel is given. Sung by the shite and chorus, it is set in hiranori, accompanied by a congruent percussion part and a non-congruent nohkan part. It is divided up into three parts, and although the shite is seated for the first two, he stands up and dances during the last one.
</p><p>
The transformation of textures of these three sections (shôdan)  moves in an exponential fashion from a level 8 to 17.
</p>

<h3>Shite exits</h3>
<p>
A mondô, a dialogue in prose between the shite and waki, followed by an ageuta, a chant set in hiranori performed by the chorus with a congruent accompaniment by the percussion with a non-congruent nohkan's part, conclude the first act.
</p><p>
The transformation of textures of these two sections (shôdan)  moves from a level 2 to 15.</p>

<section id="act2" title="Act II" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <h2>Act II</h2>
  <h3>Waki waits</h3>
<p>
The second act opens up with the waki performing a notto, a non-congruent chant sung by the waki in sashinori style, accompanied by a steady percussion beat. It is followed by a noriji, set in ônori accompanied by a congruent percussion part. It is introduced by the waki and sung by the chorus.</p>
<p>
The transformation of textures of these two sections (shôdan) moves from a level 11 to 14.
</p>


<h3>Shite re-enters</h3>
<p>
The shite's re-entrance is accompanied by the vary dynamic hayafue, an entrance music with congruent percussion and nohkan parts.  Being partially danced, its hierarchical level is set to 20, the highest level.</p>



<h3>Shite performs</h3>
<p>
The pure dance maibataraki is the highlight of the play. It is flanked on each side by a noriji set in ônori with a congruent percussion part, the first one also includes a non-congruent nohkan part. The chorus sings the first one, joined by the shite for the singing of the second one.</p>
<p>
The  transformation of textures of these three sections (shôdan) moves from 17 to 20 and down to 14.
</p>


<h3>Conclusion: kiri</h3>
<p>
The last sequence of two sections essentially maintains the hierarchical level reached by the pure dance. It starts with the short spoken dialogue kakeai  between the waki and shite, accompanied by a non-congruent percussion part, followed by the kiri, which is set in chûnori with a congruent percussion and a non-congruent nohkan parts, sung by the shite and chorus.</p>
<p>
The transformation of textures of these two sections (shôdan) moves from a level 7 to 19.</p>
