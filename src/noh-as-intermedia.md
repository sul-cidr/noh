        <h3 id="intermedia-intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In our definition 'intermedia' is a way of forming artistic expression
          that draws on the relationships between media and their cumulative
          impact. Noh theater, which combines literature, vocal and instrumental
          music, stage movement, dance, masks, costumes, and props is a
          particularly rich and sophisticated form of intermedia. Not only it
          brings together multiple forms of art, but each of them has been
          highly refined, plays a substantial role, and the correspondences
          between them are singular, intricate and wide-ranging. The goal of
          this website is to examine and interpret the parts played by and
          interactions between media in Noh.
        </p>

        <p>
          In any intermedia work, not all media will have equal importance at
          all times. At different moments, any element or combination of them
          can dominate, and this can vary further in the perception of an
          individual listener of particular interests and background. In
          time-based art forms like the Noh Theater particular weight and
          attention must be given to dimensions that change over time.
          Continuously evolving elements such as word narratives, musical
          sequences and movement of actors, come particularly strongly to the
          fore of perception due to ongoing change. Their prominent features can
          align in meaning or structural qualities to reinforce each other and
          fulfill a desired dramatic effect. But the primary role of the
          time-based components does not mean that elements like costumes or
          props that are comparatively constant do not play significant roles in
          intermedia. Always when they appear on the stage for the first time or
          when they are used for specific dramatic purposes, they can equally
          become the center of attention. Even when they remain relatively
          unchanged, they help in establishing important semantic or aesthetic
          context. They are essential to the understanding of a play as a whole
          and at times, focal elements of the dramatic narrative.
        </p>

        <p>
          The fundamental relationships between the expression of different
          media are of similarity and contrast. Neither of the two is in itself
          more dramatically impactful than the other. For example, a lively text
          delivered at the dominant central position of the stage with the
          accompaniment of a full ensemble is not automatically more dramatic
          than an unexpected but slow-paced call from behind the curtain with
          the rest of performers listening with anticipation. Dramatic tension
          is not merely a function of the combined level of energy or amount of
          new information. One can observe that uniformly powerful energy in the
          former example, and the contrast of action and stillness in the latter
          case were both achieving great dramatic interest in the scenes. When
          each element has multiple expressive dimensions (ex. music with its
          fluctuations in tempo, rhythmic organization, pitch range, styles of
          delivery and more), the interpretation of all characteristics and
          their relationships can become extremely rich and complex. Some
          prioritizing was, therefore, an inevitable part of our analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most impactful conditions for intermedia is the
          simultaneity of activity in different media layers. The intersection
          in time is undoubtedly powerful, but is not the only possibility.
          Because the duration of elements in each media in Noh is to various
          degree flexible, full and exact time synchrony is a rare occurrence.
          Many compelling intermedia relationships are forged when events in
          each of the media happen in temporal proximity or sequentially within
          the window of the viewer's memory. Sometimes, one brief but poignant
          element will cast a long shadow over a large span of time. All of this
          complicates the task of intermedia analysis, but to the extent that it
          is possible, we will attempt to proceed chronologically and cover
          different formal levels of Noh with comments spanning from full plays,
          through acts, sub-act sections, and modules, to lines of text and
          metric units defined by the music.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our intermedia analysis, we offer an interpretation, but it is
          neither exhaustive nor definitive. We hope that it will serve as
          inspiration for other possible ones and that additional resources
          including those on this website will assist in this process.
        </p>

        <h3 id="intermedia-tools">Tools of Intermedia Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          It is a common practice in the context of formal analysis of Noh plays
          to refer to Zeami's adaptation of the Gagaku concept of Jo-ha-kyū,
          where structural modules (shōdan) are grouped in sub-sets to fit
          within the following five-part scheme:
        </p>

        <table class="content-table">
          <tr class="content-table__row">
            <td class="content-table__column">Jo</td>
            <td class="content-table__column">Ha-Jo</td>
            <td class="content-table__column">Ha-Ha</td>
            <td class="content-table__column">Ha-Kyū</td>
            <td class="content-table__column">Kyū</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          While we recognize the importance of this formal concept in Zeami's
          work, it is too limiting for the analysis of the intermedia structure
          of a Noh play. Hence, we developed a method of analysis that is
          primarily based on perception that aims at showing how the form of a
          play is articulated through the interaction between its text, music,
          and dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering that the development of each media throughout the course
          of a Noh play is more or less prescribed, we ranked all the possible
          combinations between text, music and dance, where earlier stages of
          development were assigned a lower rank whereas higher one where given
          to combinations involving later stages of development. The defintion
          of the ranking system went through a five step process.
        </p>
        <h3>Step one: Transformation of each media component</h3>
        <p>
          First, we looked at the transformation of each media component over
          the course of a play, understanding that the development of each one
          is more or less prescribed. For example, at the beginning of a play,
          the 'chant' is often spoken, presented by a single actor, the waki.
          Its content is more or less factual, providing the audience with
          information about his identity, where he comes from, where he is
          going, and why. A solo song or a set of solo songs often follow this
          introduction. Next, the entrance of the shite often leads to a return
          to spoken dialogue but this time between the two actors. The songs
          that typically follow this dialogue involves the chorus with duos that
          are usually more poetic and abstract in nature as to preserve the
          mystery around the shite’s identity, that is at least until the second
          act when the veil around his identity is usually lifted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding that the meaning of the words can be reinforced or
          modulated depending on context, which is set or affected by the
          instrumental accompaniment; the rhythmic relationship between text and
          music; the motion on stage, we also looked at the overall
          transformation of the music and dance over the course of a play, which
          is also loosely predetermined. In the course of a play, the treatment
          of the text, music, dance, and the use of space evolve according to
          the unfolding story. A summary of each component’s generic
          transformation through the course of a play is listed below. It is
          important to view this information as reference model rather than
          strict and absolute trajectories:
        </p>
        <p>
          Text: It changes from unmetered narrative prose to metered poetry.
          Chant: It changes from spoken solo, to singing solo, to spoken
          dialogue, and finally to singing dialogue. Music: It changes from
          non-congruent to congruent. Space: It changes from a limited use of
          it, to a quiet dance that starts expanding the use of the stage-space,
          to a longer dance that is more extensive in its use of stage-space
          with intensified movements involving the fan and sleeves.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Step two: Transformation of the rhythmic organization of the each
          media component
        </h3>
        <p>
          Second, we looked at the transformation of the rhythmic organization
          of each media component over the course of a play. Once again we
          noticed prescribed transformations. The figure below shows the generic
          rhythmic changes of each component over the duration of a play.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rhythmic organization of the voice moves in waves from spoken solo
          to non-congruent singing, from spoken duo to congruent singing set in
          hira-nori. In the second act, it moves from non-congruent singing to
          congruent singing set this time in either ônori or chûnori. The
          rhythmic organization of the percussion instruments tends to follow
          the voice's, starting each act in non-congruent moving to congruent.
          On the other hand, the nohkan's rhythmic organization is non-congruent
          almost throughout a play, switching to congruent when accompanying the
          'pure' dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically a Noh play will include two if not three dances. The symbol
          ’ √ ’ indicates where one can be expected. The 1) √ and 3) √ are
          usually a dance-to-text section. In this case, the dance supports the
          text by mimicking the described action. The 2) √ is the crown jewel of
          a play: the ‘pure’ dance. Because of the absence of a text, this dance
          is more abstract. But also because of the absence of text, the dance
          is the sole foreground material in this section; hence it is often
          grander than the other two. It is important to view this information
          as a reference model rather than strict and absolute trajectories. The
          analysis of the plays found on this website will help illustrate this
          point since they both, in their own way, deviate from this model.

        <h3>
          Step three: Ranking basic media components based on stage of
          development
        </h3>
        <p>
          Keeping in mind that our ultimate goal was to rank all possible
          combinations between text, music and dance, we then considered the
          overall transformation of each component throughout a play,
          differentiating between earlier and latter stage of development. This
          is how we determine the following orders: singing over speaking,
          congruent over non-congruent, in the context of congruent music:
          ô-nori / chû-nori over hiranori, danced section over one without
          dance, and in the context of a danced section: 'Pure' dance over
          Dance-to-text. Other considerations included:
        </p>
        <p>
          The nohkan solo with its free rhythm and the fact that it does not
          participate to the unfolding of the story since it has no text, was
          assigned the starting level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the text of a vocal part contributes to the unfolding of the
          story, it was given a higher order than the two-hand drums solo.
        </p>
        <p>
          A texture with a larger instrumentation was ranked higher over a
          smaller one. The ‘pure’ dance being the crown jewel of most plays was
          selected as the highest ranked texture.
        </p>
        <p>The figure below summarizes the hierarchies that we established:</p>
        {% include image.html
        src="/assets/images/New-Rhythmic-Organization-2.png" %}
        <h3>Step four: Assignment of ranked position for the textures</h3>
        <p>
          Fourth, we defined the texture of a section (shôdan) in terms of its
          instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and if it includes a dance or
          not. Considering all possible sections (shôdan), we identified
          twenty-three textures. We ranked the textures from the simplest to the
          optimal, as summarized in the following figure (Note that a vocal part
          marked with the number 2 implies a duo either between two actors, or
          between the chorus and an actor):
        </p>
        {% include image.html
        src="/assets/images/New-Rhythmic-Organization-1.png" %}

        <h3>
          Step five: Assignment of hierarchical position for the textures found
          in three Noh plays
        </h3>
        <p>
          Fifth, we based our analysis of the form of a Noh play on the
          evolution of the textures of its sections (shôdan). Although we moved
          away from a formal analysis based on the Jo- ha- kyû concept and
          developed a method of analysis that is primarily based on perception,
          we still used Zeami's formal design but only as a reference model and
          as a point of comparison. The two plays showcased on this website are
          Hashitomi (category 3) and Kokaji (category 5). The former has 19
          sections (shôdan), the latter has 20. We compared their structure with
          Izutsu's, a play written by Zeami that epitomizes his model structure.
          When combining these three plays, we found that they include examples
          of twenty out of the possible twenty-three textures. It is these
          twenty textures that we have used when plotting the form of each play.
