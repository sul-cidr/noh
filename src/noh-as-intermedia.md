        <h2 id="noh-as-intermedia">Noh as Intermedia</h2>
        <p>
          The intermedia construction of Noh is unique, elaborate and somewhat
          paradoxical. Although media layers are independent of each other in
          their specialization, they are expressively unified. Materials in
          loose synchronicity seem inseparable as intermedia, fitting together
          like a glove. Several guiding principles explain this artistic feat.
          Not surprisingly, many can be traced back to the general context in
          which Noh was developed – the culture of the samurai, Japanese
          Buddhism and Chinese philosophy. It is a testament to the ingenuity of
          Noh artists that while engaging deeply with ideals of their time, they
          created an art that is timeless.

          The Breath of Yin and Yang
        </h3>
        <p>
          Literally and metaphorically, ‘breath’ is one of the primary unifying
          elements of Noh. It is the central model for the form. The recurring
          cycle of inhaling/building-up energy and exhaling/releasing it, is
          fundamental to Noh's structure. If Noh is a fractal design with
          ‘breath’ as its basic element, it repeats in every possible time-scale
          and media layer to create an infinitely complex and self-similar form.
          Conceptually, ‘breath’ also reflects the ancient Chinese philosophical
          tradition that describes the world as a constant balancing of Yin
          (dark, moon, female, inhale) and Yang (bright, sun, male, exhale).
          According to this philosophy, the two seemingly contrary forces are
          complementary, inseparable, and dependent on each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breath is foundational for Noh actors. They develop a lower abdomen
          (<em>hara</em>) breathing similar to that of Japanese martial artists.
          They learn that precise control of breath is essential to convey
          appropriate expression of the chant as well as posture and movement of
          the body. It underlies the rhythm of <em>kata</em>. From the basic
          walking step to circling around the stage with a group of
          <em>kata</em>, actors follow the energetic and spatial shape of a
          breath.
        </p>
        <p markdown="1">
          Mastering breath is crucial for the drummers as well. The
          <em>komi</em> [^1] is a particular kind of breath that is taken in
          silence, marking the beginning of drumming patterns. It consists of a
          sharp rhythmic inhale, and holding the breath deep in the abdomen for
          a while. After the build-up of internal energy through the
          <em>komi</em>, a vocal call breaks the silence and leads to a release
          by a strike. The sequence of a <em>kakegoe</em> shout followed by a
          drum-hit is ubiquitous in Noh and is a Yin and Yang pattern of its
          own.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a slightly higher formal level of the eight-beat unit

          <a href="/music/#Rhythm" target="_blank"> (<em>honji</em>)</a>, there
          is oscillation between the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi. Ōtsuzumi leads in
          the first half of the <em>honji</em> and is answered by the kotsuzumi
          in the second half. On the next level, when looking at the
          construction of a <em>shōdan</em>, sparse, rhythmically flexible

          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
            ><em>mitsuji</em></a
          >
          patterns often alternate with the more dense and decisive
          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"
            ><em>tsuzuke</em></a
          >. Following the same ‘breath’ model, a typical short
          <em>shōdan</em> involves gradual acceleration of rhythm and a build-up
          that leads in the second half to a resolution, sometimes accompanied
          by an entrance of the nohkan, ending in a brief slowdown (like in

          <a href="/kokaji/sashi/" target="_blank"><em>sashi</em> of Kokaji)</a
          >. Longer and more complex <em>shōdan</em> may consist of more than
          one ‘breath.’ The principal sections of a <em>jonomai</em> dance
          called <em>dan</em>, hold within them a special moment of significant
          deceleration called

          <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai/#Oroshi" target="_blank"
            ><em>oroshi</em></a
          >. Musicians talk about it as of a ‘stream reaching a pond.’ These
          slowdowns apply not just to music but to dance, which at this point
          comes to a standstill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The typical energetic trajectory of a large-scale <em>dan</em> (a
          group of <em>shōdan</em> in an act) matches the same pattern: a
          gradual extended acceleration and build-up, followed by a fast closure
          with a short but clear slow-down. Often, this maps also onto a
          pattern, in which the earlier parts of the <em>dan</em> use more prose
          recitation and

          <a href="/music/voices/#Non-congruent" target="_blank"
            >non-congruent</a
          >

          chanting while the later ones involve more poetry and

          <a href="/music/voices/#Congruent" target="_blank">congruent</a>

          chant. Each of the two acts also creates its own gradual build-up that
          resolves with a fast movement that closes with a slowdown. The play as
          a whole shows the same pattern with the second act raising the tempo
          and energy higher than it was in the first act, reaching the most
          cohesive section and closing with a rapid section as its ‘exhale’.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 'breath' can also be seen as a reference for synchronization
          between performers. In most sections of Noh, there is no attempt
          between performers to adhere to a shared and regular pulse. The actors
          and musician meet at intervals marked by larger units akin to
          breathing cycles. There can be a strong and sometimes very direct
          correlation of actions during these intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important synchronization signals for the shite are the
          patterns of ōtsuzumi. To illustrate, at several points in the
          <em>Jonomai</em>, the <em>uchi-hanashi</em> pattern of the ōtsuzumi
          serves as a signal to continue with the next sequence of movements.
          The pattern consists of a silent “tsu” on beat 8, “chon” on beat 1,
          and a particularly characteristic extended kakegoe “yo” from the
          second beat and half on. The interactions can be observed in the
          following three examples:
          <a
            id="jono1"
            href="#0"
            class="link__popout-window"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:05:05,01:05:27&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in the <em>kakari</em> section</a
          >, at the point when the shite is facing front, while at Square 3. The
          pattern "tsu-chon" stops the dancer and the extended
          <em>kakegoe</em> “yo” signals him to turn left and start to walk
          across the stage;
          <a
            id="jono2"
            href="#0"
            class="link__popout-window"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:10:29,01:10:50&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in the first <em>dan</em></a
          >, similar stop and start occurs on Square 2 leading to walking across
          the stage; and
          <a
            id="jono3"
            href="#0"
            class="link__popout-window"
            onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:13:51,01:14:08&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');return false;"
            >in the second <em>dan</em></a
          >
          the dancer at Square 4 synchronizes with
          <em>uchi-hanashi</em> pattern to stop, turn to the right and walk
          backward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The synchronization of the flow between the actors and the nohkan is
          less direct but it is also related to 'breath'. The actors are aware
          of the important role of the nohkan to underline emotions in crucial
          moments, outline form, or embellish the music, but many do not know
          what melodic patterns will be played when. Unlike their attention to
          the strokes and
          <em>kakegoe</em> of the ōtsuzumi, actors do not need to follow the
          nohkan's specific notes. There is, however, a parallel between the
          rhythmic flow of dance routines and that of non-congruent flute
          playing. Both the nohkan phrases and sequences of kata are shaped as
          breaths and preceded by breaths. Even if not strictly synchronized,
          the intermittent action and resting creates a similarly fluctuating
          energetic stream. Overlapping nohkan patterns and adjacent dance
          routines create a connection between them while retaining a highly
          desired fluidity.
        </p>
        <p markdown="1">
          From the actor's point of view, the Yin and Yang dichotomy is
          important in two ways. First, as outlined above, it helps them create
          an effective pacing of performance. Second, it dictates that
          characters or situations that represent one, either Yin or Yang, must
          also represent the other. This adds depth and subtlety to their
          acting. A common instruction states, ‘in rain, be bright; during the
          day, be calm.’ As the actor Tastushige Udaka explained[^2], ‘you
          should imagine that you are dancing even if you are sitting still.’
          Mastery of acting in Noh is not about literally portraying extreme
          emotions but about evoking them in a powerful but subtle way.
        </p>

        <h3 id="fluidity">
          Fluidity of Time, Space and Identity
        </h3>
        <p>
          All in Noh is always fluid and gradual. It comes, among others, from
          striving for the Yin and Yang equilibrium. The timing of events within
          individual layers of intermedia, as well as synchronization between
          them, is intuitive and flexible. Regular and shared beats are reserved
          for moments of intense focus and occur smoothly, almost imperceptibly.
          The performers are interconnected, maintaining an intermedia flow but
          often without the need to synchronize strictly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drummers take the <em>komi</em> together but its duration is
          flexible and depends on each musician. The following beat is
          approximate and the <em>kakegoe</em> that precedes it is freely
          extended to match more general expressive needs. Many sections and
          layers of Noh are in non-congruent and

          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
            >flexible rhythmic setting</a
          >. Even when percussionists start coordinating pulse in a

          <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
            >strict rhythmic setting</a
          >

          it does not mean that the chant or nohkan will do the same. The

          <a href="/hashitomi/jonomai/" target="_blank"><em>jonomai</em></a>

          or

          <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"
            ><em>maibataraki</em></a
          >

          dances with all instruments rhythmically aligning are rare and serve
          as a climax. But even there, the dance is only loosely synchronized
          with the musical beat. For instance, when the musicians reach the
          <em>oroshi</em> in the <em>Jonomai</em>, the dancer will end up
          stopping entirely, although there is no strict beat when that needs to
          happen. This is because the flow of energy that underlies the movement
          of bodies on stage is equally fluid. Even angular or sudden gestures
          result from an internal control that is continuous and 'smooth.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The fluidity of the aesthetic form expresses the fluidity of content.
          The minimalism of staging or even lack of references to particular
          locations allows for the space to be constantly redefined. Like in
          Kokaji, a few hints in the text allow viewers’ imagination to adapt
          and turn the imperial palace into Munechika’s home, workshop, or the
          road to the Inari Shrine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The polyvocality of text and transfer of identity between shite, waki,
          and jiutai add to the fluidity. The main actor can speak as a
          narrator, sharing a description, quote a poem, entering into a dialog
          with other characters and deities, and communicating their inner
          thoughts. Moreover, their voice can be transferred. An example of this
          occurs at the beginning of Kokaji’s first <em>ageuta</em>. Typically,
          the first line of text of an <em>ageuta’s</em> is recited by the shite
          or waki, and then repeated. When the jiutai repeats the text, it
          implies that it took over the communication of the thoughts of the
          character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Noh plays’ plots unfold around the identity of the shite. The
          audience is invited to discover the shite's identity and empathize
          with them. Noh is based on the Buddhist doctrine that stipulates that
          identity is an illusion. The action in <em>mugen</em> Noh plays,
          considered by many its artistic pinnacle, could very well be the
          waki's dream or illusion. The main character appears in the first act
          as a ghost hiding in the body of someone whom the waki could normally
          encounter in the dramatic present. By the end of first act we may
          learn the true identity of the original host of the spirit but when
          they return in the second act, they remain a mere spirit, rather than
          the person they once were. They are on the journey to enlightenment,
          or as in Hashitomi, they may not even know whether they are a spirit
          of a woman or of a flower. The fluidity of expressive means is a
          reflection of this fluidity of identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is interesting to observe how intermedia constructs this
          instability of identity. In Hashitomi, when the shite appears, the
          first clue is visual. The actor wears a mask of a young elegant woman
          and a costume that depicts flowers along fences. The movement is
          graceful and slow. Since the waki has spoken of performing a mass for
          flowers it is equally possible that the main character is a spirit of
          a flower or a village woman. The text, sung by the shite in the
          <em>Rongi</em> gives the name "Yūgao," but because this is a common
          flower name the identity remains ambiguous. As the play progresses,
          the flower's name becomes a woman’s nickname. In the ai-kyōgen as in
          the following <em>shōdan</em>, the name is associated with Genji's
          lover, Lady Yūgao. The dance imitating her, when Genji talks about
          Lady Yūgao, establishes the most direct connection. Through
          intermedia, the richness of the identity develops.
        </p>
        <h3 id="abstraction">
          Engaging Abstraction
        </h3>
        <p>
          Intermedia, through immersing all the senses, can imitate reality,
          although theatrical traditions differ in the level of realism of
          representation. Noh is on the abstract side of the spectrum. Its
          acting is highly formalized. The actors' faces are covered with a mask
          that prevents them from showing emotion. Their movement and dance
          comes from a prescribed vocabulary of aestheticized <em>kata</em>,
          only some of which are even symbolically mimetic. Their speech is
          recited or chanted using standardized patterns shared by all plays
          without regard to their different stories. The ‘voice’ of the
          protagonist is frequently separated from their body, being transferred
          to the jiutai. The costumes indicate categories of characters by
          defining their gender, profession, and rank, with garments, colors and
          patterns that are strictly prescribed by tradition. The stage props
          are symbolic and often limited to a single one placed centrally. The
          music is composed from a fixed collection of rhythmic and melodic
          patterns that are reused in a play, and across different plays. The
          text is the only original element in each play, although the language
          is formal, quotations from poetry are prevalent, and the plot is
          minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of all of these abstract intermedia elements forces
          the audience to be more active, projecting their own meaning onto the
          action. Like reading a book, watching a Noh play allows the audience
          to recognize ‘clues’ and engage them into one’s own act of imagining.
          The Noh mask epitomizes this projection, allowing viewers to piece
          together the ambiguity and richness of information from multiple
          dimensions. Because Noh is about the contemplation of a character, the
          best plays and performances elicit empathy with the protagonist. In
          such plays, the climax of the experience is not a dramatic plot twist,
          but the abstract dance with all of the musicians, including the nohkan
          performing in rhythmic synchronicity. When words cease, we are left
          with the pure spirit, beautiful and vulnerable to our gaze.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Kurai">
          <em>Kurai</em>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Noh actors and musicians often use the word <em>kurai</em>, which
          literally means ‘rank.’ The word was originally used to categorize
          plays according to the main character’s social status, dignity, and
          age. A higher <em>kurai</em> demands more subtlety and solemnity in
          the performance. It uses the most refined quality of masks and
          costumes, the pitch of the chant and <em>kakegoe</em> of drummers is
          lower and more solemn, and the tempo of music and dance is slower. On
          the contrary, a lower (lighter) <em>kurai</em> does not demand as much
          subtlety. Hashitomi and Kokaji both lighter in <em>kurai</em>, feature
          young character as protagonists; the plays are short; the dramatic
          themes are not particularly serious. Consequently, they have been
          included in introductory repertoire for young actors and musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this usage, Noh actors and musicians use <em>kurai</em> to
          identify the style of performance. In this case the word refers to the
          atmosphere created by the protagonist’s character, emotions, and
          dramatic setting. An actor or musician may say, ‘Let’s perform this
          music and dance in Hashitomi’s <em>kurai</em>.' Other actors and
          musicians immediately understand what is the proper tempo, timbre,
          gravity and atmosphere of the music and dance. They might imagine
          Hashitomi’s protagonist, a ghost of young lady (or a flower) who, in
          the evening of an autumn day tells of her encounter with a noble man,
          Genji. The intermedia nature of <em>kurai</em> and its importance is
          one of the main keys to understanding Noh as intermedia.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, Act Two of Hashitomi includes a section called
          <em>Jonomai</em>, an instrumental dance without text or singing. The
          exact same dance is also performed in other plays, including Izutsu,
          Nonomiya and Eguchi featuring women who are older and have different
          life experiences. The style of performance differs between them
          reflecting each protagonist’s age and circumstances. Musicians and
          actors adjusting the music and dance according to the character's
          emotional state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example of <em>kurai</em> is in the way musicians and dancers
          perform the same patterns in different contexts. The main section of
          the
          <a href="/hashitomi/jonomai/" target="_blank"><em>Jonomai</em></a>
          dance is among others accompanied by the nohkan playing a fixed
          sequence of melodic patterns. The same patterns, however, are used in
          the

          <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"
            ><em>Maibataraki</em></a
          >

          dance in the second act of Kokaji, featuring a lively god as the
          protagonist. Although both use the same melodies, the
          <em>kurai</em> of both are entirely different. The choreography of the
          first section (<em>kakari</em>) of both dances is almost the same: the
          shite steps from square 1 to 3, turns left and goes to 5, then moves

          Recognizing the proper <em>kurai</em> helps the performers achieve a
          better level of synchronization (or sharing of the Yin-Yang breath) of
          music and dance. In the

          <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank">IoI ranking list</a>, the
          ‘non-congruent’ rhythm, which does not follow the standard 8-beat
          frame, and flexible drumming, which does not clearly present 8-beat
          strokes, occupy a large part of Noh drama. In the first stage of
          learning, each part is taught without any reference to the other
          parts. Dancers are taught only how to follow a fixed sequence of
          <em>kata</em> (prescribed movement) but not the music to which they
          will ultimately need to fit their dancing. Singers make it a rule to
          practice their singing without any reference to drum beats. The unique
          Noh pedagogy creates a path to “synchronization” or “congruency” on a
          higher level by introducing the <em>kurai</em> as connecting all parts
          together.

          <em>Kurai</em> combines media layers that would otherwise be
          "incongruent". The importance of the intermedia congruency is
          beautifully described by the actor, UDAKA Tatsushige who said: “If
          there is no nohkan playing in a <em>Kuse</em>, it is as if the peaks
          of the mountains were lost”.

          Noh is an intermedia art form of great expressive coherence. It
          breaths Yin and Yang as if in a fractal design. Through the fluidity
          of intermedia materials, it embraces the impermanence of things and
          people. The abstract quality of its forms invites the audiences to
          engage more deeply and become part of a rich and unique intermedia
          experience of Noh.
