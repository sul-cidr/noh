    <h1></h1>

    <p>
      While users are encouraged to set their own navigation paths, the website
      offers two: a top-down and a bottom-up path.
    </p>

    <h4><strong>Top-down path</strong></h4>

    <p>
      This path starts with the plays. It has two levels of access: Play Level,
      and the Shōdan Level. Both are accessible from the menu under ‘Plays’.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="/hashitomi/#act1" target="_blank">Play Level</a></h4>

    <p>
      The center of navigation is the Shōdan Map consisting of blocks
      representing the <em>shōdan’s</em>
      <a href="/form/#ITI" target="_blank">Intermedia Texture Index</a>. {%
      include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Blocks.png" %}
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking on a block moves the video to the beginning of that
      <em>shōdan</em>. Sliding the button through the video timeline at the
      bottom of the video screen updates the time position within the map. Both
      interactions result in updating the corresponding summary info in the
      bottom right table.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clicking on the red shōdan’s name at the top of the table, leads to its
      intermedia analysis on the Shōdan Level.
    </p>

    <p>
      The top left-hand side menu provides access to information about the
      play’s overall formal structure.
    </p>

    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/fwdicon.png" %}

    <p>
      Clicking on links with this icon moves the video to the beginning of the
      related <em>shōdan</em>, whereas clicking on an underlined red
      <em>shōdan's</em> name leads to its intermedia analysis on the Shōdan
      Level.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="/hashitomi/kakaru-1" target="_blank">Shōdan Level</a></h4>

    <p>
      Comments, analysis, Text and the Shōdan Map are located on the left side,
      while an intermedia score is found under the video.
    </p>

    <p>
      The top left menu is divided in two. ‘Aspects’ introduces basic comments
      about the shōdan, while “Intermedia’ presents its intermedia analysis.
    </p>

    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/infoicon.png" %}

    <p>
      Clicking on the red <em>shōdan’s</em> name above the ‘Aspects’ and
      ‘Intermedia’ menu line opens a new tab with its associated definition
      page.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Text and Shōdan Map sub-windows can be open or collapsed by clicking
      on the title or the 'arrow' icon. Moreover, the lines of text are
      clickable and advance the video and score to their matching position
      within the <em>shōdan</em>. On the other hand, clicking on a block in the
      Shōdan Map updates the video to the beginning of the Intermedia analysis
      of the corresponding <em>shōdan</em>.
    </p>

    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/BottomBar.png" %}

    <p>
      Users control the layers displayed in the intermedia score by clicking on
      ‘Filters’ located on the right hand side of the bottom navigation bar.
      Finally, the same bar offers two methods of navigating within a
      <em>shōdan</em>: Clicking on either the backward or forward buttons around
      ‘Sentence’ updates the video and score by increments of sentences, whereas
      scrolling through the given <em>shōdan</em> using the sliding button,
      allows for increments in number of seconds.
    </p>

    <h4><strong>Bottom-up path</strong></h4>

    <p>
      This path starts with information on various elements of Noh, such as:
      Actors, Music, Movement, Text, Staging, Form, and a Catalog of Shōdan. It
      is accessible from the menu under ‘Elements of Noh’.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Catalog of <em>shōdan</em> provides a description of the structure and
      characteristics of a fair number of <em>shōdan</em>. At the end of each
      page, links are provided to example of the same <em>shōdan</em> in the
      context of one or both plays.
    </p>

    {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/infoicon.png" %}

    <p>
      Finally, when the icon is found over a video rolling over it shows
      additional information.
