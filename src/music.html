          <h2>Music</h2>

          <p>
            Noh relies greatly on musical expression. Its structure, emotive
            tone and narrative flow are carried in great part by the singing of
            actors and the accompaniment of an instrumental ensemble. Music is
            present throughout. It begins with highly evocative tuning of the
            instruments (<em>oshirabe</em>) and continues through intoned
            recitations, chant and instrumental numbers. Besides some
            unaccompanied entrances or exits of actors, or when a stage property
            is brought in, music is ubiquitous.
          </p>

            The <a href="/music/voices" target="_blank">vocal music</a> in the
            form of Noh chant (<em>utai</em>) plays a central role and is
            performed by a principal actor (shite), a supporting actor (waki), a
            kyōgen actor (ai) and chorus (jiutai). The instrumental ensemble and
            its music (<em>hayashi</em>) serve to accompany singing, dances, and
            some entrances and exits of actors. It is comprised of one pitched
            instrument: the
            <a href="/music/nohkan" target="_blank">nohkan</a> (noh flute), and
            two unpitched percussion instruments: the
            <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi" target="_blank">ōtsuzumi</a>
            (hip drum) and
            <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi" target="_blank">kotsuzumi</a>
            (shoulder drum). About half of the plays in current repertoire
            include a third drum, the
            <a href="/music/taiko" target="_blank">taiko</a> (stick drum). With
            a few rare exceptions, taiko only joins in for the second half of a
            play. Between percussion strokes the drummers perform highly
            expressive vocal calls (<em>kakegoe</em>), which add an original
            vocal dimension to their parts.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Rhythm">Rhythmic Organization</h3>
          <p>
            The rhythmic organization in Noh is highly sophisticated, complex
            and carries immense dramatic potential. Its basic unit of time is an
            8-beat measure (<em>honji</em>), which is used for all instrumental
            music, such as dance, entrance and exit music. Although the
            <em>honji</em> is also the basic unit of time for vocal music, it is
            possible to sporadically encounter measures of 2, 4, or 6 beats,
            used to accommodate the syllabic structure of the text. Despite this
            mostly fixed underlying structure, the immense flexibility of the
            individual beats and multiple ways of synchronization between
            instruments result in great rhythmic variety and expressive
            richness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Flexibility of pulse is the norm in Noh. Based on expressive needs,
            performers intuitively adapt the beats' duration. Moreover, some
            beats of the eight-beat unit are extended or shrunk, predictably
            according to performance traditions. For instance, it is customary
            for the eighth beat to be extended and for beats 1, 3 and 5 to be
            shrunk. When the beats are shrunk the odd beat is not followed by a
            kakegoe. Regular pulse is almost exclusively found in dance,
            <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/noriji" target="_blank"
              ><em>Noriji</em></a
            >, and some entrance music.
          </p>

          <p>
            The notion of strict synchronization between all players is also an
            exception rather than the norm. For instance, the first beat of the
            eight-beat unit, which for Western ensembles would traditionally
            serve as an accent and a point of rhythmic unity, in Noh is often
            silent. It is "performed" internally in the mind of the musicians a
            process referred to as <em>komi</em>. In the
            <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
              >video</a
            >
            showcasing strict and flexible rhythmic settings, the second, fourth
            and sixth beats are most of the time performed as <em>komi</em> as
            well. The sound that follows is timed according to an individual
            musician's sense of pacing. The notion of “togetherness” is not
            based on exact coincidence of the attack but on a cohesion of
            overall flow, energy, and expression. In the same spirit, most of
            the time the nohkan’s part is metrically independent from the
            percussion part and there are many instances when that is the case
            for the chant as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two types of rhythmic correlation between the voice, flute
            and percussion instruments. The correlation is 'congruent' when the
            nohkan and/or vocal parts align with the eight-beat measure
            (<em>honji</em>), whereas it is said to be 'non-congruent' when they
            do not. The former provides rhythmic stability, the latter rhythmic
            flexibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the non-congruent rhythmic setting, the degree of independence
            vis-à-vis the eight-beat measure varies according to the
            instruments: A non-congruent vocal line is totally independent from
            the eight-beat unit, in the sense that it does not start or end on a
            specific beat, and at no time is it expected to align with a
            specific beat. A non-congruent nohkan part begins and ends at some
            specific points often related to the text, but the music between
            these two points in not synchronized within the eight-beat measure.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no conductor in noh. Most of the time chant or dance
            initiate and lead the musical flow. Jiutai and
            <em>hayashi</em> considered equal, are ancillary to the leading
            chant or dance. Within the <em>hayashi</em>, the hierarchy continues
            from stage right to the left. Taiko leads, if present, followed by
            ōtsuzumi, kotsuzumi, and finally, the nohkan. This relationships can
            occasionally be adjusted when one of the lower ranked instruments is
            being performed by someone of greater experience. At certain
            structural moments, it is also common that the actors wait for
            instrumentalist to start or finish their parts.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Pitch">Pitch Organization</h3>
          <p>
            The melodic language of Noh is not dependent on absolute pitches.
            Within the <em>hayashi</em>, the nohkan is the only pitched
            instrument, yet there is no pitch coordination between nohkan and
            utai.
          </p>

          <p>
            The loudness of instruments is relatively constant. The lower
            register of the flute is naturally softer and is used according to
            dramatic or formal function. The <em>kakegoe</em> as well as chant
            can match in loudness the dramatic character of the scene or role.
          </p>

          <h3 id="Form">Form</h3>
          <p>
            The music in Noh draws on a common collection of rhythmic and
            melodic patterns. Many of the same patterns occur multiple times
            within a single module (<em>shōdan</em>), and across different
            <em>shōdan</em> of a play as well, leading to a great unity and
            similarity. But this seeming limitation is well balanced by the
            abundance of variants and tempi, a flexibility with which the
            patterns are sequenced into larger phrases, and by original
            expressive inflection of specific plays and particular performances.

          <h3 id="Transmission">Transmission</h3>
          <p>
            The vocal styles, instruments with their performance techniques, as
            well as melodic and rhythmic language are unique to Noh, and
            mastering them requires many years of specialized training. Noh is
            taught through aural and oral transmission. Each role and instrument
            has its own tradition preserved and taught within hereditary schools
            named after their founders. There are five shite, three waki, two
            ai-kyōgen, five ōtsuzumi, four kotsuzumi, two taiko, and three
            nohkan schools. Most of them publish or hand-copy summary notation
            of their school’s individual parts but these are meant only as
            learning aids as all performances are done from memory. For more
            information with examples please refer to the page on
            <a href="/music/notation/" target="_blank">Notation</a>
          </p>

          <h3 id="Notation">About our Notation</h3>
          <p>
            A clarification must be made about the music notation used on this
            website. Conversely to Western tradition there are no complete study
            scores for any given play. Each of the twenty-four schools has their
            own individual scores and variants of notation. In the performance
            of a Noh play, it is the school of the shite that becomes the
            reference and it is the responsibility of the waki and ai-kyōgen
            actors and musicians to adapt their parts to the shite’s. Scores for
            individual instruments are written on a grid of eight blocks and
            they are read from top to bottom and from right to left.
          </p>

          <p>
            On this website, all scores combining more than one instrument are
            our own transcriptions. We retained the characteristic note-heads of
            various percussion instruments’ strokes but set them on horizontal
            lines. Occasionally, due to limited space we have provided
            summarized scores, merging the ōtsuzumi’s and kotsuzumi’s patterns
            into a single line.
          </p>

          <p>For example, the following rhythmic patterns:</p>
          {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Complete.png" %}
          <p>have been notated as:</p>
          {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Notation-1-Condensed.png" %}

          <p>And these patterns:</p>
          {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Complete.png" %}
          <p>have been notated as:</p>
          {% include image-no-background.html
          src="/assets/images/Notation-2-Condensed.png" %}

          <p>
            where the left strokes on the first, third and sixth beats
            corresponds to the ōtsuzumi’s stroke, the right ones to the
            kotsuzumi’s. We have followed the same sequencing when merging
            <em>kakegoe</em> and stroke, thus the <em>'yo''</em> on the second
            half of the fourth beat is called by the ōtsuzumi player at the same
            time as the kotsuzumi player performs a <em>pu</em> stroke.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, when the taiko is playing with the other two hand-drums,
            only its part has been notated.
