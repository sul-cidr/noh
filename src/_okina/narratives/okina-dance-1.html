    The first <em>Ageuta</em> is the dramatic and intermedia climax not only of
    the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>, but of the whole first act. It brings a new
    and refreshing sound: the jiutai, the last performer who had not yet taken
    part in the play. The jiutai’s first entrance always delineates an important
    moment in a play, hence it's special name: <em>shodō</em>. The
    <em>Ageuta</em> is also the first <em>shōdan</em> accompanied by the full
    <em>hayashi</em> – the two percussion instruments and the nohkan. It
    produces the richest and most rhythmically consolidated texture so far with
    the chant set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the percussion in strict
    rhythmic setting.
