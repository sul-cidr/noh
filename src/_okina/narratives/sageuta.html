    With its text set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied percussion instruments in
    strict rhythm, the <em>Sageuta</em> is the first of a sequence of five
    consecutive congruent <em>shōdan</em>. The text of the second act has now
    shifted from prose to verse.
  </p>

  <p>
    A nostalgic tone is introduced. It started with the preceding
    <em>shōdan’s</em>
    <time datetime="00:43:57.000" title="00:43:57"> last line </time>: “<em
      >Rain dampens Genken's (Yüan Hsien) gate</em
    >,” in which rain is a metaphor for tears. It continues in the
    <em>Sageuta</em> which starts with another metaphor for tears:
    <time datetime="00:44:42.000" title="00:44:42"> dampened sleeves </time>.
    This is carried over to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Ageuta</em> with a
    reference to the
    <time datetime="00:45:40.000" title="00:45:40">limpid moon</time> soaring
    over a desolate evening. The source of the nostalgia is only revealed in the
    following <em>shōdan</em> – the <em>Rongi</em>, when the shite asks “<em
      ><time datetime="00:48:48.000" title="00:48:48">
        When will they meet again?</time
      ></em
    >,” a clear and poignant reference to a lover's yearning.
  </p>

  <p>
    The positioning of this short chant between the <em>Issei</em>-chant and the
    <em>Ageuta</em> is easier to appreciate when the viewer considers the shape
    of the vocal line across the three <em>shōdan</em>. The
    <em>Sageuta</em> begins in the low register, completing the descending
    trajectory from high to medium of the <em>Issei</em>-chant, before moving up
    towards the medium range, thus serving as a transition towards the high
    range of the coming <em>Ageuta</em>.
