      later revealed that the shite is hidden inside of it. The prop represents
      a dilapidated dwelling with a thatched roof. Its symbolic entrance gate is
      hung with a <em>hashitomi</em> or <em>hajitomi</em>, the source of the
      play's title. <em>Hashitomi</em> means ‘half <em>shitomi</em>’, an oblong
      wooden panel shutter, the upper edge of which is hinged and the loose
      lower end can be pushed open. Yūgao evening flowers and gourds creep over
      it.

    curtain that will represent Lady Yūgao's
    <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank">dwelling</a>.
