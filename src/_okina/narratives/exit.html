    The exit of the actors and musicians happens in silence. The shite is the
    first one to exit, followed by the waki. If a <em>tsukurimono</em> was used
    in the play, the stage assistants would then remove it. Once the actor or
    stage assistant has passed the Second pine, the curtain is lifted and then
    pulled back down once he has entered the anteroom. From this point, the
    musicians exit in the same order they entered, nokhan player first, followed
    by the kotsuzumi, ≈çtsuzumi,and taiko players. Upon reaching the Second pine,
    the curtain is pulled back partially on one side. The jiutai members exit
    through the back left side door, starting with the back row. Even as they
    are exiting the stage, actors, assistants and musicians exhibit great
    modesty and decorum. Thus, the audience holds its applause until the last
    musician exits.
