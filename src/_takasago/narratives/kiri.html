      After the juitai completes reciting Genji's poem, the spirit of Lady Yūgao
      asks for prayers and disappears at dawn with the crowing of cocks and

    The play’s final <em>shōdan</em> consolidates its energy using most of its
    intermedia resources. The shite and jiutai sing a text set in
    <em>ōnori</em> in an active tempo, one of the most dynamic congruent styles.
    It is accompanied by the drums in strict rhythm, joined at the end by the
    nohkan performing a variation of its cadential <em>tome no te</em> pattern,
    which closes with the high and dramatic <em>hishigi</em> tone. The
    choreography keeps the dance on the strong central stage positions (Squares
    3, 4, and 9), as if to suggest that the spirit of Lady Yūgao has finally
    taken full shape and is now shining with its full strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first three lines of the poem that Prince Genji wrote to Lady Yūgao were
    introduced in the <em>waka</em>, the preceding <em>shōdan</em>. The
    <em>kiri</em> opens with the jiutai singing the poem's last two lines,
    repeating three times its very last line, “<em
      >hana no iugao/ the flowering 'evening face'</em
    >.” This repetition stresses the words “evening face,” the nickname of the
    lady that Prince Genji saw in the shadow of the white flower. The line is
    composed of seven syllables, and when set in <em>ōnori</em>, fits very well
    within a single <em>honji</em>, as it is the case for the first two
    iterations. The last and third line is spread over two
    <em>honji</em> creating a dramatic slow-down. Thus, as the jiutai repeats
    three time the name of the flower associated with Lady Yūgao, the shite who
    occupies the prominent center-stage performs the grounding classic sequence
    of structural <em>kata</em>:
    <a href="/movement/medium-zigzag/" target="_blank">Medium zigzag</a>,
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>, and
    an <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the jiutai sings
    <em
      ><time datetime="01:19:57.000" title="01:19:57"
        >“Always pray for me,”</time
      ></em
    >
    the two protagonists turn toward each other. As the shite sings the
    line,“<em>Tsume ni wa tomurai / I beg of you,</em>,” he takes Two Steps
    towards the waki, as if to stress the importance of the request. It is
    noteworthy that the word “<em>tomurai</em>” has a double meaning, indicating
    both “to pray” or “to visit.” Taking this in to account, the scene could
    also have a double-meaning: the spirit of Lady Yūgao asking the monk for a
    prayer and a desperate request for a visit from Prince Genji.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Kiri</em> is full of mimetic
    <em>kata</em>, including in the closing section. Over the words “<em
      ><time datetime="01:20:44.000" title="01:20:44"
        >The tolling of the bells
      </time></em
    >,” the shite turns left (East in Kongō tradition) and looks up as if to
    appreciate the rising sun. In loose synchronization with his words, the
    kotsuzumi’s patterns include upbeat attacks leading to
    <em>honji’s</em> fifth beat. Although these patterns are not unique to
    Hashitomi, they could be interpreted as mimicking the tolling of the bells.
    Then, with a Forward Point, the shite points in the direction of the bells
    and as he sings, <em>“…announce the coming of dawn.”</em>, and performs a
    Flipped Left Sleeve and a
    <a href="/movement/cloud-fan/" target="_blank"> Cloud Fan </a>, a pattern
    often used to suggest looking into the distance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the
    <time datetime="01:22:20.000" title="01:22:20"> spirit enters </time> the
    <em>tsukurimono</em>, as the monk turns his body toward her with reverence.
    The nohkan joins with its closing
    <a href="/music/nohkan/tomenote" target="_blank"><em>tome</em></a> pattern.
    This announces and intensifies the final section of the play. The shite sits
    down very slowly, creating a solemn feeling. The stage assistant
    synchronizes the lowering of the hashitomi door with the shite's motion.
    Then, the shite moves his Fan to Left Hand in preparation for a
    <a href="/movement/pillow-fan/" target="_blank"> Pillow Fan</a>, a pattern
    that suggests disappearance, which he performs as the jiutai sings
    <em
      ><time datetime="01:22:58.000" title="01:22:58"
        >“…becoming one with the dream.”</time
      ></em
    >.
