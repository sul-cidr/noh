      The <a href="/actors/#Ai" target="_blank">Ai-kyōgen</a> actor in costume TO BE DESCRIBED kneels at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a> while the waki and the two attendants remain kneeling at Square 5 and 6, respectively. The local villager slides to face the waki when listening to his questions and slides back to face front to deliver his responses.

    TBD - here's what we wrote in Hasitomi: <br>
    The <em>Ai-kyōgen</em> interlude in Hashitomi has a typically simple
    intermedia character. The kyōgen actor converses with the waki with very
    little movement and mostly without music.
  </p>

  <p>
    In preparation for the <em>Ai-kyōgen</em>, the percussionists fold their
    chairs, as all musicians
    <time datetime="00:22:45.000" title="00:22:45">
      kneel in a straight line facing sideways
    </time>
    to indicate that although they are on stage they are not involved.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, half way through the interlude, when the kyōgen turns back to speak
    with the waki, the drummers return to sitting on the chairs. It is the
    tradition of the Morita school of nohkan playing to layer the final section
    of the <em>Ai-kyōgen</em>, with a melodic pattern called
    <em>shimo no takane</em>. It is a non-congruent melody that includes few
    original patterns but also others akin to
    <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a
    >,
    <a href="/music/nohkan/takane-hane" target="_blank"><em>takane hane</em></a
    >, and <em>kuse-no-ryo</em>. The end of the
    <em>shimo no takane</em> coincides more of less with the end of the dialogue
    between the kyōgen and the waki. Having memorized the text, the nohkan
    player positions his patterns accordingly. The melody also serves as a
    signal to the actors in the backstage that the second act is about to begin.
