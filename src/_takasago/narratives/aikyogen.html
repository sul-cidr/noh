      The <a href="/actors/#Ai" target="_blank">Ai-kyōgen</a> actor kneels at <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a> while the waki and the two attendants remain kneeling at Square 5 and 6, respectively. The local villager slides to face the waki when listening to his questions and slides back to face front to deliver his responses.  Following Okina, as is the case for this recording, it is traditional for Kyogen actor to wear a Suō Kamishimo formal wear despite playing a role of a villager.

  <p>
    The <em>Ai-kyōgen</em> interlude has a very simple
    intermedia character. The kyōgen actor converses with the waki with no movement and no music. Only once, toward the end, when the priest and the villager agree to get on the boat together, the kyogen actor raises up and looks out as he notices favorable wind for their sails.
