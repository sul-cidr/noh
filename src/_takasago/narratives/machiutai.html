  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> is the first in the second act and opens the Waki Waits dan. Because Takasago is a celebratory play, it begins with music. In other plays, the waki often starts alone and is later joined by the ensemble. The instrumental introduction is a relatively fast segment of four measures that culminates in a cadential <em>uchikiri</em>, accompanying the waki and Wwkizure as they stand and return to their positions from Act 1—in Squares 2, 3, and 5. This is a notable deviation, as they usually do not move in Act 2 of other plays. This movement underscores the significance of the waki's role in the play. The celebratory atmosphere calls for a faster tempo, and this <em>shōdan</em> is performed briskly, maintaining a forward energy that complements the theme of travel.</p>
