      The monk arrives at Gojō to visit the one-time home of Lady Yūgao. He
      observes that the dwelling is still covered by the same yūgao flowers but
      overgrown with weeds. He begins to recite a poem that references spiritual
      learning and poverty.

    A <em>tsukurimono</em> stands on Square 8, representing what used to be Lady
    Yūgao’s dwelling. The waki sings, standing on Square 5, facing it. This
    <em>Kakaru</em> is spread over five eight-beat measures (<em>honji</em>). It
    starts simply with the waki singing a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> chant
    accompanied by the drums in flexible rhythmic setting. Half-way in the third
    <em>honji</em>, the kotsuzumi player initiates a
    <time datetime="00:39:55.000" title="00:39:55"> switch </time> from flexible
    to strict setting, a motion recognizable by his much shorter
    <em>kakegoe</em>. At this point, the percussionists also switch from the
    sparse <em>mitsuji</em> to the steadier <em>tsuzuke</em>patterns. This
    change coincides with a
    <time datetime="00:40:08.000" title="00:40:08"
      >switch in the text from prose to verse </time
    >, as the waki starts reciting a
    <a href="/text-hashitomi/#Waki-waits" target="_blank"> poem</a>. It refers
    to a Confucian disciple and to ‘empty gourds,’ a metaphor for poverty. This
    foreshadows the theme of sadness that will weave through the next three
    <em>shōdan</em>.
