  <p>
    CHeck if this is useful......The monk introduces himself and explains his intentions in the simplest way,
    by speaking unaccompanied. The speech is tranquil, steady, and performed
    almost without movement while the actor remains on Square 9. Although the
    overall texture remains simple, the inclusion of the narrative that answers
    the 'who,' 'why,' 'what' and 'where' about the monk, gives this
    <em>shōdan</em> a higher Intermedia Index than the preceding
    <em>Nanoribue</em>.
