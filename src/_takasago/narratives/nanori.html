    The monk introduces himself and explains his intentions in the simplest way,
    by speaking unaccompanied. The speech is tranquil, steady, and performed
    almost without movement while the actor remains on Square 8. When sharing
    his decision to travel he briefly turns slightly to the right and then back.
