  <p>The priest introduces himself and states his intentions plainly, speaking without accompaniment. His delivery is tranquil and steady, with almost no movement, as he remains on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 8</a>. When he declares his decision to travel, he underscores it with a brief turn to the right before returning to face forward.</p>
