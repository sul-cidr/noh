      The old couple engages in a dialogue, answering the priest's questions
      voiced by the juitai. In their exchange, the old couple identifies
      themselves as 'the paired pine gods of Takasago and Suminoe, appearing
      before you here as husband and wife.' The gods then invite the priest to
      travel to Sumiyoshi, they board the boat and leave.

      REDO
      <br />The shite, kneeling center stage at
      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a>, slides
      left to face the waki as he delivers the line, '…all within the
      sovereign's land will share forever in the glory of the reign.' When the
      jiutai, speaking for the shite, confirms, 'To Sumiyoshi I will go now,'
      the shite stands up, moves to center stage at
      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 4</a>, and
      performs two silent, large steps to mimic his journey to Sumiyoshi. After
      that, the shite and shitezure walk over the bridge to exit the stage.

    The <em>Rongi</em> is a chant in which the shite customarily alludes to or
    reveals his identity. For this reason, it typically concludes the first act,
    as is the case here. Ordinarily, a <em>Rongi</em> that closes the first act
    does not feature a part for the nohkan; however, in this instance, the
    <em>Rongi</em> does include this element. Based on the text, the shōdan may
    be divided into three sections. In the first, the couple discloses their
    identity; in the second, their happiness is presented as a consequence of a
    virtuous reign; and in the third, the topic shifts to their departure for
    Sumiyoshi.
  </p>
  <h3>Part I</h3>
  <p>
    This section features a statement by the jiutai, representing the waki,
    followed by a reply from the shite and shitezure. The jiutai’s passage
    serves as a celebration of the enduring union of the “Twin Pines.” The
    atypical repetition of the opening line, “these celebrated pine branches,”
    intensified by the nohkan’s takane pattern, underscores one of the central
    themes of the play. As the duo reveals their identity, the shite performs
    his first kata within this shōdan: rising onto his left knee from a kneeling
    position, he slides to his left to face the waki, thereby imparting a tone
    of solemnity to the revelation.
  </p>
  <h3>Part II</h3>
  <p>
    The reference to the “glory of the reign”—a theme revisited in the second
    act—is highlighted through two interconnected actions. As the jiutai sings,
    “All within the sovereign’s land will share forever in the glory of the
    reign,” the nohkan enters with its hishigi takane pattern, while the shite
    once again rises onto his left knee and slides left to face the waki. This
    sequence further elevates the significance of the statement.
  </p>
  <h3>Part III</h3>
  <p>
    As preparations are made for the departure to Sumiyoshi by boat, an
    atmosphere of excitement prevails, effectively conveyed by the unusual
    metric structure. The syllabic configuration of the third and fourth lines
    in this section is “Iunami no / migiwa naru (5/5) ama no obune ni / uchi
    norite (7/5)” (“So saying, where the evening waves meet the shore, he boards
    a fishing boat”). Typically, these two phrases would each match a honji. In
    this case, however, the first three syllables of the second hemistich, “ama
    no,” are joined to the previous phrase, altering the structure to “Iunami no
    / migiwa naru ama no (5/8) obune ni / uchi norite (4/5).” To accommodate the
    extended hemistich, an okuri (a two-beat measure) is inserted, creating a
    longer-than-usual pause reminiscent of ma, which serves to emphasize
    “obune,” the boat. This moment is further distinguished by the entry of the
    nohkan’s kuri age pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    Excitement about the impending journey to Sumiyoshi is also reflected in the
    sequence of kata. For instance, as the jiutai sings “Sumiyoshi ni mazu
    yukite” (“To Sumiyoshi I will go now”), the shite, facing the waki, raises
    his fan and loosens his grip to signify that the winds are favorable for the
    voyage. The shite then rises and moves to the front of the stage (Square 4),
    where right and left steps mimic the act of boarding the ship. This is
    succeeded by an open-retreat kata, with the shite's extended arms and
    lowered sleeves signifying the boat’s sail. His progression toward Square 1,
    accompanied by the nohkan’s roku no ge pattern, confirms his departure for
    Sumiyoshi.
