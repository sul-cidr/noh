    <em>Oshirabe</em> exemplifies the expressive use of intermedia at its
    minimum. The spectacle, which will eventually involve a richness of
    elements, begins with only music sounding from behind the curtain. The
    instruments are introduced sequentially, starting with the nohkan, followed
    by the kotsuzumi, and finally the ōtsuzumi who completes the
    <em>hayashi</em>. There is no singing, and the percussionists do not utter
    any

    >. After a minute or two, the <em>Oshirabe</em> is concluded as the
    musicians drop out, one after the other in reverse order. Music performed
    invisibly is at its most fleeting. The audience is offered a mere ‘ghost’ of
    it. The absence of other elements intensifies the anticipation. As the
    viewers fall into silence, they get to appreciate the visual aspects of the
    stage in the atmosphere evoked by the music. This minimalistic beginning is
    a perfect starting point for a gradual intermedia development that is the
    essence of a Noh play.
