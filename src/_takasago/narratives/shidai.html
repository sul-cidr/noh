    TThe very short <em>Waka</em> is both a contrast and a bridge between the
    two major <em>shōdan</em>: the <em>Jonomai</em> and the <em>Kiri</em>. It
    releases tension built by the intense aestheticism of the instrumental dance
    and prepares for a narrative ending.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the instrumental dance <em>Jonomai</em>, rich in use of various
    movements and extensive stage-space, the intermedia richness temporarily
    drops with the <em>Waka</em>, as the shite performs a single <em>kata</em>,
    a held Raised Fan. He does so standing in center stage, which allows him to
    retain energy and exert command of the stage. The music, which maintains the
    dynamic percussion strict rhythmic setting, brings back chanting. The
    <time datetime="01:17:40.000" title="01:17:40">melisma </time> of shite's
    non-congruent
    <a href="/music/voices/#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant
    extends the dance's aesthetic focus and recalls the highly ornamented slow
    nohkan melody.
  </p>

  <p>
    The percussion part forms another bridge between two rhythmically congruent
    but divergent <em>shōdan</em>. The slow speed of the preceding
    <em>Jonomai</em> gave it a free-flowing temporal feeling that was
    well-suited for the dance of an elegant young lady. It is in clear contrast
    with the steady-beat of the <em>ōnori</em> chant of the coming
    <em>Kiri</em>. In the <em>Waka</em>, the drums start with two
    <em>honji</em> of broad and sparse
    <time datetime="01:17:26.000" title="01:17:26"
      ><em>mitsuji</em> patterns</time
    >
    then, accelerate toward the
    <time datetime="01:17:52.000" title="01:17:52">last two</time>
    <em>honji</em> of <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns. At the same time the initial
    extended <em>kakegoe</em> of the ōtsuzumi player that seemed to imply a
    flexible setting are answered by short <em>kakegoe</em> of the kotsuzumi
    player. By the time they play <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns they are both in
    strict rhythm, setting up the beat for the <em>Kiri's</em>
    <em>ōnori</em> chant.
