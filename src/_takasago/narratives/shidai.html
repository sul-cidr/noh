    The song follows a traditional ageuta style, beginning with two lines sung
    by the waki and wakizure. This is however followed by an uchikiri pattern,
    enhanced by the nohkan playing the special takane hishigi pattern, which
    incorporates a high hishigi note to evoke the imagery of traveling
    peacefully across the ocean. In the second half, unlike in other ageuta, the
    mitsuji pattern appears only once, replaced by a continuous tsuzuke pattern
    instead. Typically, there would be a contrasting uchikiri pattern, but here
    it maintains its energetic character, creating an illusion of movement
    through time and space that is fitting for a travelling song.

  <p>
    The tori at the beginning, with its truncated first line, further enhances
    this sense of movement. As the waki performs a series of kata culminating in
    a tsukiashi—rising onto the toes and striking the ground with the heels—it
    symbolizes the journey and arrival at Takasago. The repetitive last line
    complements this theme of arrival, both poetically and musically,
    reinforcing the overall narrative of travel and destination.
