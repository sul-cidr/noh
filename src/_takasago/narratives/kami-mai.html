    Since the exchange between the actors is now accompanied, there is a slight
    increase in the Intermedia Index. The percussion instruments play in
    flexible setting, offering a slow, sparse and free-flowing accompaniment
    that complements the unmetered vocal parts. The monk, singing a chant set in
    <em>sashinori</em>,
    <time datetime="00:17:52.000" title="00:17:52"
      >, insists that the shite</time
    >
    reveals her name. The shite resists and, as though to stress her position,
    changes mode of delivery and replies in <em>kotoba</em>. However, while
    keeping her name secret, she confirms
    <time datetime="00:18:04.000" title="00:18:5204">
      that she is no longer alive </time
    >. The <em>Kakaru</em> concludes with the following
    <time datetime="00:18:24.000" title="00:18:24">two lines</time>:
  </p>

  <p>
    <em
      >“At a certain mansion,<br />
      I could always be found, indeed it is so.”</em
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    In the <em>Genji monogatari</em>, Lady Yūgao’s dwelling was surrounded by a
    fence filled with ‘evening face’ flowers. Although at this point in the play
    the actual identity of the shite’s character is still unknown, the monk
    speculates about it. The first line of the above sentence, which should be
    attributed to the apparition, is actually sung by the priest, who may have a
    hunch about her identity. When she sings the remaining line,
    <time datetime="00:18:33.000" title="00:18:33">
      she turns towards the monk</time
    >, as if acknowledging his intuition. This confirmation coincides with a
    change in the character of the percussion material, which moves from sparse
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji</em></a
    >
    to the regular
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"
      ><em>tsuzuke</em></a
    >
    pattern. The
    <time datetime="00:17:58.000" title="00:17:58">switch</time> subtly
    increases the density of the <em>shōdan</em> and raises expectations for the
    one to come.
