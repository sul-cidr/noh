    Based on a 9th-century <em>tanka</em>, the 'song' is the play’s first sung
    poetic text. The introduction of chant and poetic language raises the
    Intermedia Index. However, because it is performed without accompaniment,
    sung by the shite who remains motionless at the First Pine, the overall
    Intermedia Index stays relatively low.

    The 'song' is a compelling example of Noh becoming a stage for the thoughts
    of the shite and waki, and a melting of distinctions between them. The
    poetic text sung by the woman refers to an offering of flowers to Buddha,
    alluding to the memorial service for flowers performed by the monk. One
    could speculate that her apparition voices the thoughts of the monk. Thus,
    the two characters have now become one despite their physical distance—the
    woman remaining on the bridge while the monk is sitting at the waki’s post
    (Square 5). The veiled dreamy quality of the scene is emphasized by the
    shite's slight lowering of the mask, a gesture called <em>kumorasu</em> –
    ‘cloud the face,’ often performed to suggest contemplation.
