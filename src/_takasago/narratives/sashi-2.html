    •	For the final line of text, shite slides left to face the waki as the jiutai sings 'shikishima no kage ni yoru tokaya,' a line that resonates with the themes of Japanese poetry and national identity<br>
    •	Shikishima (敷島): This is an ancient poetic name for Japan, meaning "Blessed Isles". In the context of the play, it can also refer to "Shikishima no michi" or "the way of the Blessed Isles," which is a term for poetry itself.<br>
    •	no Kage ni yoru (の影に寄る): This translates to "to draw nigh/approach the shadow of". <br>
    Therefore, a possible interpretation in the play is that "all living things, they say, draw nigh to the Blessed Isles," where "Blessed Isles" represents poetry or Japan itself. <br>
    It signifies the deep connection between Japanese culture, especially poetry, and the very essence of the nation, personified by the evergreen pine trees in the play. The Noh play Takasago is particularly known for its celebration of longevity, harmonious relationships, and the enduring nature of Japanese poetry and spirit.
