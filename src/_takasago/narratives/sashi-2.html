  <p>This <em>Sashi</em> shōdan is the second in the three-shōdan structure, in which the preceding <em>Kuri</em> is traditionally likened to the flow of water from a vigorous waterfall into the slower stream of the Sashi and finally to a tranquil pond in <em>Kuse</em>. As such, it is slower than <em>Kuri</em> and prepares for even slower <em>Kuse</em>.</p>

<p>This shōdan has a low index of intermedia as it features minimal movement visually, while its text and music are arhythmic and non-congruent. It is an exchange of thoughts between the old man and jiutai, in which they discuss the pine in Takasago and other pines, referring to their ancestry and noting that, compared to seasonal changes, pines remain constant throughout the seasons. It is said that pines bloom just ten times in a thousand years and continue to inspire our hearts to poetry.</p>

<p>The stillness of the actors is imbued with highly expressive quality of the music, through the non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> chant of the old man and juitai. It is particularly felt in the closing exchange between them (starting in Measure 6), stating that "all living things are drawn to the Shikishima islands"—an ancient poetic name for Japan that signifies the deep ties between the nation and its poetic heritage. The chant slows down and becomes more melismatic. After the shite sings the penultimate line, the jiutai takes over for the last line. The nohkan joins with the <em>Kuse no rio</em> pattern that slowly extends over the instrumental part. Unlike common practice, this exceptional occasion features an extension of the ending of this <em>shōdan</em> by inserting an extra penultimate honji, which adds ceremonial slowness to the nohkan part. It serves as a great preparation for the upcoming even slower <em>shōdan</em>, <em>Kuse</em>.</p>
