    <div class="section-introduction__definition">
      The jiutai, speaking for Yūgao spirit, begins the recitation of a poem
      Prince Genji sent to her, recalling memories of the time they were
      together. As an instrumental dance, the <em>Jonomai</em> does not engage
      with the story. However, it represents an expressive climax colored by the
      narrative that precedes it. The actor and the audience can project into
      the dance, character traits and identities of the iugao flower, Lady
      Yūgao, and the emotions of the romantic affair with Genji.

    At the end of the <em>Kuse</em>, the jiutai singing for the spirit of Lady
    Yūgao starts to recite the very first poem that Prince Genji wrote to her,
    but as if taken by emotions, as if poetic words could not fully express her
    deepest feelings anymore, she interrupts the recitation, and begins to
    dance.

    The elegant <em>Jonomai</em> dance closely interweaves choreography with
    music. It is composed of five sections, which can be accessed by clicking on

  <p>
    The form of the <em>Jonomai</em> is cyclical because it is primarily
    articulated through the nohkan’s
    <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai" target="_blank">repeated patterns</a>.
    They are identified in the score below the video with the following legend:
    Chū – C, Kan – K, Kan no Chū – KC, Ryo – R, Oroshi – Or and Dan – D.
  </p>

  <p>
    While a dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> is structured around salient mimetic
    <em>kata</em>, an instrumental dance is not. Instead, particular structural
    <em>kata</em> paired with vocal calls of the percussion play a specific
    formal function. For instance, <em>kata</em> involving the fan, often
    accompanied by sleeve motion, are used to anticipate the beginning of a
    section. Having performed the <em>Jo</em> and <em>Kakari</em> with a closed
    fan, the shite announces the imminent beginning of the <em>First dan</em> by
    <time datetime="01:08:13.000" title="01:08:13">Opening of the Fan</time>.
    After having brought it in front of his face for a Raised fan <em>kata</em>,
    the dancer brings it down to waist-level, where it is commonly held. Then, a
    <time datetime="01:11:56.000" title="01:11:56">
      Fan Reverse Hold and a Right Sleeve Flipped
    </time>
    signals the upcoming beginning of the <em>Second dan</em>. Lastly, a
    <time datetime="01:15:25.000" title="01:15:25">Left Sleeve Flipped</time>
    announces the coming of the <em>Third dan</em>. While these
    <em>kata</em> anticipate an upcoming <em>dan</em>, the actual beginning of
    each <em>dan</em> is in fact marked by the extended <em> kakegoe 'iya'</em>,
    which within the congruent sections are reserved exclusively for this
    purpose. Finally, the shite signals the dance's closing phase by
    <time datetime="01:15:51.000" title="01:15:51"> Resetting the Sleeves</time>
    and Renesting of the Fan to standard hold.
  </p>

  <p>
    While arm motions involving the fan and sleeves and specific
    <em>kakegoe</em> announce the beginning of a section, foot motion paired
    with a percussion pattern articulate the sections' closing. This is done by
    stamping, followed by the ōtsuzumi’s six consecutive strokes
    <em>shikake</em> pattern. For example, the shite concluded the
    <em>kakari</em> by performing a
    <time datetime="01:07:45.000" title="01:07:45">
      Left Stamp and Right Stamp</time
    >
    followed by <em>shikake</em>. The closing of the
    <time datetime="01:11:33.000" title="01:11:33"> First </time> and
    <time datetime="01:15:08.000" title="01:15:08"> Second </time>
    <em>dan</em> introduce variations on the stamping and a
    <em>shikake</em> sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The very end of the <em>Jonomai</em> is also signaled with a
    <em>kata</em> and tempo change. The shite concludes the dance by performing
    a <a href="/movement/raised-fan/" target="_blank">Raised Fan</a>
    <em>kata</em>. Commonly performed as he sings the <em>ageha</em> solo line
    in the <em>Kuse</em>, it can however appear anytime. By performing the
    Raised Fan <em>kata</em> at the conclusion of the dance, the shite who has
    been silent throughout the <em>Jonomai</em>, is setting up an expectation
    for chant. The transition is further underlined by a sudden change of tempo.
    Controlled by the percussionists, the tempo gradually and steadily
    accelerates throughout the Third <em>dan</em> to reach the dance’s fastest
    speed at its penultimate <em>honji</em>. Then, it slows down in preparation
    for the nohkan’s conclusive and slow <em>tome</em> pattern, which in
    Hashitomi’s case,
    <time datetime="01:17:26.000" title="01:17:26">overlaps</time> with the
    beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Waka</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The differences in the use of stage-space also help articulate the dance’s
    five-section structure. The <em>Jo</em> takes place exclusively on
    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>. The
    <em>kakari</em> and the Third <em>dan</em> see the shite dancing across the
    whole stage, whereas stage-space use in the First and Second <em>dan</em> is
    rather limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use of the stage-space in the <em>kakari</em> is also noteworthy. The
    nohkan player introduces its core sequence of patterns called <em>Ji</em>,
    which he repeats four times, while the shite opens the stage-space. Holding
    a closed fan in his right hand, the shite first traverses the right lateral
    over the first <em>Ji</em> —Squares 1 to 3— then the front stage over the
    second one— Squares 3 to 5— and finally the left-right transversal over the
    last two <em>Ji</em> —Squares 5 to 1. This trajectory does not only open the
    stage-space, it also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. Backstage
    positions such as Square 1 and 8, further from the audience, are essentially
    positions of released tension. They are often used as starting and closing
    positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other hand,
    frontstage positions such as Square 3 and 4 and center-stage Square 9,
    closer to the audience, are positions of strength. Therefore, the motion
    from Square 1 to 3 is building momentum, bringing the shite from a position
    of released tension in Square 1 to the front in Square 3. The motion from
    Square 3 to 5 maintains momentum since the dancer remains in the stage’s
    forefront. Finally, the motion from Square 5 to 1 releases tension, taking
    the shite from frontstage to backstage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>kakari’s</em> choreography exemplifies the overall modularity of
    Noh. The same stage-space use can be seen in both instrumental dances
    featured on this website: the <em>kakari</em> of this slow and elegant
    <em>Jonomai</em>, and the first section of the dynamic and virile
    <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"><em>Maibataraki</em></a>
    dance in Kokaji.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another intermedia pointer in the <em>Jonomai</em> is the
    <em>oroshi</em> pattern. It is recognizable aurally as it is a
    two-<em>honji</em>-long
    <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai#Oroshi" target="_blank">slow-down</a>,
    during which the shite moves to a quieter stage position and stops. For
    instance, in the First <em>dan’s oroshi</em>, he takes
    <time datetime="01:09:07.000" title="01:09:07"> Four Steps Back</time> to
    move from the dynamic Square 3 to the weaker Square 2. In the Second
    <em> dan’s oroshi </em>, the shite performs a
    <time datetime="01:12:48.000" title="01:12:48"> release-tension</time> move
    by taking Seven Steps Back from the strong Square 9 to the quieter Square 6.
