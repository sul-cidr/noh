     The shite opens with a series of kata with a straight cross on the left side before moving to Square 8, where he initiates another series of kata with a straight cross central stage, concluding it with a sequence of stamps at Square 9, before returning to Square 8.

<p>The <em>Issei Chant</em> begins with slower music that gradually returns to an energetic pace, maintaining intensity through dynamic movement and numerous mimetic kata. Three poems are quoted, each structured with a first line from the shite followed by a second line from the juitai, mirroring the music's waves of slow and fast tempo. This cyclical repetition and rich movement build momentum, drawing attention in preparation for the forthcoming Kami Mai dance.</p>

<p>The first poem, reflecting on the beauty of Spring snow at Asakagata Bay, is illustrated by the shite's small zigzag movements while pointing and rotating as if gazing into the distance, commencing in Measure 4. The second poem begins in the second half of Measure 7, accompanied by sparse yet noisy music in Measure 9. Here, when the shite proclaims, "a thousand years of evergreens fill my hands," he emphasizes this line with stamps and motions reminiscent of the Sumiyoshi God discussing his birth.</p>

<p>The music slows again at the start of the third poem, returning to the shite in Measure 13. This poem describes picking plum blossoms to place in his hair. The shite performs the Raise Fan Flat Above Head gesture, invoking snow. He then holds a flat fan under his sleeve as if catching snowflakes, moving his head side to side as he watches them fall.</p>
