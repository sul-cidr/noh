  <p>The short <em>Jō-no-ei</em> <em>shōdan</em> is characterized by its fast pace, featuring energetic and assertive movements by the shite. The loud, strict rhythmic patterns led by the taiko enhance the overall intensity, although the melismatic chant—quoting waka poetry about the gods' birth at Aoki Field—often makes the text difficult to hear. Throughout the performance, the God dances vivid kata, including three Stamps and an Overhead Fan, which forcefully underline his proclaimed emergence from the waves. To emphasize his name, Sumiyoshi, the shite performs an Open Retreat. The music begins slower but returns to its energetic character, maintaining momentum throughout.</p>
