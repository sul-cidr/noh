    Following the previous shōdan, which focused on the visual and aural realities of the characters, this <em>Sashi</em> shifts to exploring more internal world and the expression of thoughts. The transition to this introspective world coincides with it being the first <em>shōdan</em> featuring a flexible rhythmic setting of the percussion. It introduces the idea of creating poetry through the metaphor of spreading a mat of thoughts. The word “noburu,” used in the context of extending the mat, is significant because it also refers to poetry and can imply both "to utter" and the notion of something that is extended or enduring like a reign. This term will reappear in the final shōdan, <em>Rongi 2</em>. </p><p>

The theme of poetry, one of the three principal themes of the play, is further emphasized at the end of measure 6 with the Iri melodic pattern highlighting the word "mat." This musical cue serves as a lead-in to the crucial line, “we share the feelings in our hearts,” which, as is typical in <em>Sashi</em>, is accompanied by a shift in percussion to <em>tsuzuke</em> pattern and the entrance of the nohkan, followed by a slow instrumental closing that underscores the significance of this line and allows space for reflection. In contrast to common practice, at this celebratory occasion, the ending is extended by inserting an additional <em>honji</em>, resulting in expressive slowness that we hear when the nohkan part extends its melody to match it.
