      The old couple is depicted as a symbol of an auspicious reign. Takasago represents the ancient era of the <em>Manyōshū</em>, the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry, compiled around 759 AD, while Sumiyoshi symbolizes the present time and the reigning emperor of the Engi era.

  <p>
    With minimal stage movement in this <em>shōdan</em> the intermedia interest lies in its text–music relationships. The central dialogic <em>Kakeai</em> <em>shōdan</em> is articulated in three sections—<em>jo</em>, <em>ha</em>, and <em>kyu</em>—paced slow, faster, and fastest, with a brief slow-down at the very end. Each section is prompted by a question or remark from the waki and answered by the shite and shitezure. The musical design of each section moves from extended solo exchanges to a duo in unison, with the percussion articulating section boundaries. The first two sections conclude with a duo of shite and shitezure; the last ends in a duo of shite and waki.</p>

<p>In <em>jo</em>, the waki is puzzled that the two elders come from the paired pines of Takasago and Suminoe; they explain that distance does not hinder a true union—“a couple paired for life.” For this section the couple face each other; thereafter, they address the waki. In the extended unison, the <em>nohkan</em> softly plays the traditional <em>fufu-no-te</em> (“pattern for a couple”) at the words “<em>aioi no fufu</em>,” underscoring the theme of paired harmony. </p>

<p>In <em>ha</em>, the dialogue links the place-names to themes that seed the larger structure of the play: Takasago to poetry and <em>Suminoe</em> to auspicious reign. This foreshadows that the later <em>Kuse</em> will dwell on poetry while the <em>Rongi</em> will expound on rule. There is deliberate contrast of musical delivery; the shite speaks in <em>kotoba</em> about reign, while the shitezure sings of poetry. </p>

<p>In <em>kyu</em>, once the waki grasps the symbolism, all contemplate the scene: the deepening color of the pines and the serenity of spring, mirroring the waki’s calm after doubt.</p>

<p> Throughout, the percussion joins with <em>mitsuji</em> patterns; the <em>ha</em> section closes with a single <em>tsuzuke</em>. In the climactic <em>kyu</em>, performers return to <em>mitsuji</em> but, uniquely in Takasago, add two successive <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns to create an extreme acceleration before the contrasting slow descent into the cadential <em>otoshi</em> ("to fall down"). This cadence becomes the switch into the next <em>shōdan</em>, <em>Ageuta</em>.
