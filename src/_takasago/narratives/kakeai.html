      The old couple is depicted as a symbol of an auspicious reign. Takasago represents the ancient era of the <em>Manyōshū</em>, the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry, compiled around 759 AD, while Sumiyoshi symbolizes the present time and the reigning emperor of the Engi era.

    TBD <br> The shite and tsure sing together twice when addressing the fact that they are referred to as a ‘pair’. These two references are sequentially supported by the entrance of the percussion instruments, and then, by the nohkan’s entrance.
    The core idea of the play is positioned in this shōdan, where alternating between singing and speaking Takasago is associated with poetry, Suminoe with the reign.
