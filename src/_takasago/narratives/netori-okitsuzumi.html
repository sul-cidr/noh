  <p>
At very special occaions, like the one of our recording, and particularly when Takasago follows Okina, the traditional <em>Shidai</em> music is replaced by an entrance piece called <em>Netori Okitsuzumi</em>. It is distinctive as it features only two instruments – the kotsuzumi and the nohkan - and at first, they alternate entrances. As the nohkan plays shifting melodic patterns the kotsuzumi responds with recurring one spread over two honji, which we label as A-A’. After two such exchanges, with progressively shorter phrases of the nohkan, in the third kotsuzumi joines the nohkan. The fourth solo entrance of the nohkan brings the opening of the curtain and as the kotsuzumi joins, the waki and two wakizure make their slow and dignified entrance. 
</p><p>

The celebratory quality of the entrance of the waki and his cohort is underlined by a sequence of three formal gestures out of which, normally only the last one would have been enough. And so, immediately following his entrance, the waki performs the Catch the Entrance <em>kata</em>, a form of formal <time datetime="00:04:31.000" title="00:04:31">appearance</time> appropriate for a First Category play. He then offers the patrons a deeply respectful <time datetime="00:06:06.000" title="00:06:06">bow</time>. Finally, he performs the <em>tappai kata</em>, a formal gesture of collecting his sleeves and drawing arms together for<time datetime="00:06:34.000" title="00:06:34">prayer</time>.
</p>

<p>The shōdan can be divided into three shorter purely instrumental sections leading to a fourth, longer one, that accompanies stage action:</p>
  <table class="content-table" width="100%">
    <tr class="content-table__row">
      <td class="content-table__column white greentext" width="15%">I</td>
      <td class="content-table__column white" width="85%">The nohkan opens the shōdan with a <time datetime="00:00:10.000" title="00:00:10"><em>Ryo</em></time> that focuses on its lower register, followed by a <time datetime="00:01:20.000" title="00:01:20"><em>Kan</em></time> pattern that moves to the higher register. The kotsuzumi follows with the introduction of its pattern: <time datetime="00:01:43.000" title="00:01:43">A-A’</time>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="content-table__row">
      <td class="content-table__column beige greentext">II</td>
      <td class="content-table__column beige">The nohkan <time datetime="00:02:17.000" title="00:02:17">performs</time> the <em>Naka no takane</em> pattern, followed by the kotsuzumi’s <time datetime="00:02:42.000" title="00:02:42">A-A’</time> pattern.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="content-table__row">
      <td class="content-table__column white greentext">III</td>
      <td class="content-table__column white">The nohkan <time datetime="00:03:19.000" title="00:03:19">begins</time> with the <em>Takane hane</em> pattern this time joined by the kotsuzumi’s <time datetime="00:03:31.000" title="00:03:31">A-A’</time> pattern.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="content-table__row">
      <td class="content-table__column beige greentext">IV</td>
      <td class="content-table__column beige">The final section <time datetime="00:04:05.000" title="00:04:05">starts</time> again with the nohkan alone. Soon after, the curtain is raised as the nohkan continues a series of patterns. As the waki his attendants enter, the kotsuzumi performs a sequence of repetitive patterns: <time datetime="00:04:30.000" title="00:04:30">A-A’</time>, <time datetime="00:05:08.000" title="00:05:08">A-A-A-A’</time>, <time datetime="00:06:15.000" title="00:06:15">A-A”-A’</time>, <time datetime="00:06:51.000" title="00:06:51">B-A’</time>, where "B" is performed faster and functions as a cadential pattern preparing the final one with a slow-down.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>

Interestingly, while the name <em>netori</em> traditionally refers to tuning music, in this context, it transforms into an elaborate showcase of multiple melodic patterns and is performed to accompany a rich entrance and greeting by the actors.
