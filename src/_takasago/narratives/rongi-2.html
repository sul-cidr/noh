<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

<p>This <em>Rongi</em> is an expression of joy and celebration that highlights the scenery, the pine trees, and the reign, often using poetic references to Bugaku dances. It is a chant in which the shite typically alludes to or reveals his identity; thus, it commonly concludes the first act. In this instance, however, the <em>Rongi</em> fulfills the role of the <em>Kiri</em>: the final <em>shōdan</em> of the play. It is following a very energetic <em>Kamimai</em> but as the taiko stops playing, it helps calm into a tone more suited for closure.</p>

<p>Based on the text, the <em>shōdan</em> can be divided into three sections. The first part is a reverence to Sumiyoshi, comprising a single exchange between the shite and the jiutai. The second part celebrates the reign and introduces two shorter exchanges between the two singing bodies. The final part is a blessing sung by the jiutai, notably referencing two Bugaku dances and ensuring the play concludes on a distinctly joyful note.</p>

<h3>Part I</h3>
<p>This section consists of a reverence to Sumiyoshi articulated in two utterances: the first by the jiutai and the second by the shite. As in the first <em>Rongi</em>, the opening line of text is repeated, but only the initial utterance is set in <em>mitsu-ji utai</em>, while subsequent lines sung by the jiutai are in the more dynamic <em>tsuzuke utai</em>. During the jiutai’s statement, the shite, who was initially facing backward, turns to face forward. The rhythmic structure of the shite’s lines in <em>mitsu-ji utai</em> is less dynamic than that of the jiutai’s; however, this is counterbalanced by a series of engaging <em>kata</em>.</p>

<p>The first <em>kata</em> sequence begins with a Forward Point, Swirl Sleeve, and a Cloud Fan as the shite sings “Koe mo sumu nari Suminoe no” (“maidens’ voices ring out clear at Suminoe”), followed by a Scooping Point, Open-Retreat, and a Stamp, which aligns with a reference in the text to the Bugaku dance, Seigaiha. Seigaiha is not only a traditional dance but also a pictorial wave pattern representing the “Blue Ocean Waves,” symbolizing peace and happiness.</p>

<h3>Part II</h3>
<p>The lines in this section are shorter, creating a quicker exchange between the jiutai and the shite and leading to increased alternation in vocal texture between <em>tsuzuke utai</em> and <em>mitsu-ji utai</em>. The text introduces a celebration of the reign, one of the play's three principal themes. Whereas <em>kata</em> performances are confined mainly to Square 1 during the first part, in this section, they expand to cover much of the stage, matching the celebratory mood of the text.</p>

<p>The shite advances to the front stage at Square 3, performing the Take the Corner <em>kata</em>. Remaining front-stage, he moves to Square 5 before returning to Square 1, producing a visual cadence for the final two lines of this part. Moving from a strong stage position to a weaker one effectively suggests closure.</p>

<h3>Part III</h3>
<p>In the final section, the jiutai brings the play to a close with blessings as the shite presents a final round of dynamic <em>kata</em>. The text references two dances from the Bugaku repertoire, both accompanied by upbeat music: the first, “Shenshu raku” (“Thousand Autumns”), is paired with a sequence of stamps, while the second, “Manzai raku” (“Ten Thousand Years”), features a temporary shift in the chant’s rhythmic setting from <em>hiranori</em> to the highly dynamic <em>chūnori</em>.</p>

<p>The text then refers one last time to the “pine couple” using the affectionate term <em>aioi</em>—a moment emphasized by the nohkan’s <em>tome no takane</em> pattern. This is followed by a closing sequence of <em>kata</em>: in Measure 7, the shite performs a Cloud Fan, with a dynamic variation that raises his right hand (a variation of Open Retreat), representing the reflection of pine trees in the sea, similar to the Seigaiha dance. Measure 8 features an Open Retreat as the shite watches again. In Measure 12, he scoops the left sleeve of his robe while discussing festive robes. In Measure 13, he performs a Backing Point and a Right Circle <em>kata</em>, spreading his arms wide to ward off evil, a movement known in Bugaku for quelling demons. Measures 15–16 involve opening the arms and then pulling them in as if to collect and hold blessings; Measure 17 includes seven stamps that mimetically illustrate dancing as the text states “a dance to bring joy.” Measures 17 and 18 culminate in the ostuzumi decorating this final segment with strong strokes on every second beat, giving it a more dance-like feel.</p>

<p>Normally, the shite would stamp two times to mark the end of a Noh performance. However, because this is a celebratory version of Takasago, especially following <em>Okina</em> (as in this recording), the shite performs three stamps, representing Yang from Yin and Yang. At this point, the nohkan plays the <em>hishigi</em> pattern, which is typically not needed during the conclusion of a show. The high note adds additional energy and closure, while the shite swirls his left and right sleeves to further enhance the celebration. This last section of Takasago is often performed as a <em>shūgen</em>: a short piece to conclude a celebratory one-day Noh performance.</p>

<p>Music in the jiutai is characterized by fast, vigorous <em>tsuzuke</em> rhythms that express wonder and celebration, particularly in measure 18 where all the beats intensively fill with syllables. Following the very fast <em>Kamimai</em> with the dynamic taiko, this feels refreshing and airy.</p>
<p>The <em>Rongi</em> serves as an expression of joy and celebration, highlighting the scenery, the pine trees, and the reign, often enriched by references to Bugaku dances. The titles of these pieces serve as valuable poetic allusions. Within the performance, there are several mimetic elements that vividly illustrate different moments, including an exchange between the shite and the jiutai.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the performance, the waki turns away from the shite, creating a cinematic wide-angle effect that emphasizes the broader celebration of life, particularly through the gentle sound of wind rustling in the pines.</p>

<h3>Kata Types</h3>
<p>Three types of <em>kata</em> are presented:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Two mimetic types:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>One serves to represent watching something.</li>
            <li>The second imitates an action.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Structural:</strong> The stamp at the end of Measure 8 signifies the conclusion of the first Bugaku dance and opens the stage for Measures 9–11.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific measures further illustrate the mimetic actions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Measure 7:</strong> The Cloud Fan is performed in a dynamic variation with a Swirl Fac, raising the right hand (a variation of Open Retreat), symbolizing the act of looking downward at pine trees reflecting in the sea, akin to the Seigaiha dance.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure 8:</strong> An Open Retreat follows, reinforcing the act of watching.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure 12:</strong> The shite scoops the left sleeve of his robe while discussing festive attire.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure 13:</strong> In the Backing Point and Right Circle <em>kata</em>, the shite spreads his arms wide to “ward off evil,” a gesture known in Bugaku for quelling demons.</li>
    <li><strong>Measures 15–16:</strong> The shite opens his arms and then pulls them in, as if to collect and hold blessings.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure 17:</strong> Seven stamps illustrate the phrase “a dance to bring joy.” In Measures 17 and 18, the ostuzumi decorates this final segment with strong strokes on every second beat, enhancing its dance-like quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the shite normally stamps twice to indicate the end of the performance, in this celebratory version of <em>Takasago</em>, particularly following <em>Okina</em> (as in this recording), the shite performs three stamps, representing Yang from the Yin and Yang duality. Additionally, the nohkan plays the <em>hishigi</em> pattern, which is usually not necessary at the conclusion of a performance. This high note contributes extra energy and closure, while the shite swirls his left and right sleeves, enriching the celebratory atmosphere.</p>

<p>This last section of <em>Takasago</em> is often performed as a <em>shūgen</em>: a short piece to conclude a celebratory one-day Noh performance.</p>

<p>The music in the jiutai is characterized by fast and vigorous <em>tsuzuke</em> rhythms that convey wonder and celebration, particularly evident in Measure 18, where all the beats intensively fill with syllables in singing. Following the previous very fast <em>Kamimai</em> with dynamic taiko, this segment feels refreshing and airy.</p>
