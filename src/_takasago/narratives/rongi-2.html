<p>This <em>Rongi</em> is an expression of joy and celebration that highlights the scenery, the pine trees, and the reign, often using poetic references to Bugaku dances. It is often performed as a <em>shūgen</em>: a short piece to conclude a celebratory one-day Noh performance. Typically, <em>Rongi</em> is a chant in which the shite alludes to or reveals his identity; thus, it commonly concludes the first act. In this instance, however, the <em>Rongi</em> fulfills the role of the <em>Kiri</em>: the final <em>shōdan</em> of the play. It follows a very energetic <em>Kamimai</em>, but when the taiko stops, it creates a refreshing contrast and a lighter—though still very energetic—texture for the play’s final words. The <em>shōdan</em> involves many kata, some directly illustrating the text and others symbolically underscoring its structure.</p> 

<p>Based on the text, the <em>shōdan</em> can be divided into three sections. The first part is a reverence to Sumiyoshi, comprising a single exchange between the shite and the jiutai. The second part celebrates the reign and introduces two shorter exchanges between the two singing bodies. The final part is a blessing sung by the jiutai, notably referencing two more Bugaku dances and ensuring the play concludes on a distinctly joyful note.</p> 

<h3>Part I</h3> 
<p>This section consists of a reverence to Sumiyoshi articulated in two utterances: the first by the jiutai and the second by the shite. As in the first <em>Rongi</em>, the opening line of text is repeated, but only the initial utterance is set in <em>mitsu-ji utai</em>, while subsequent lines sung by the jiutai are in the more dynamic <em>tsuzuke utai</em>. During the jiutai’s statement, the shite, who was initially facing backward, turns to face forward. The rhythmic structure of the shite’s lines in <em>mitsu-ji utai</em> is less dynamic than that of the jiutai’s; however, this is counterbalanced by a series of engaging <em>kata</em>.</p> 

<p>The first <em>kata</em> sequence begins (at the end of Measure 6) with a Forward Point, a Swirl Sleeve, and a Cloud Fan, followed by a dynamic variation that raises his right hand, then a variation of Open Retreat that echoes the text’s image of watching pines reflected in the water. This is followed by a Scooping Point, Open Retreat, and a Stamp, aligning with the reference to the Bugaku dance Seigaiha. Seigaiha is not only a traditional dance but also a pictorial wave pattern representing “Blue Ocean Waves,” symbolizing peace and happiness. The <em>kata</em> again mimic the god watching the scenery. The final Stamp has a structural role, marking the conclusion of the first Bugaku-dance reference.</p> 

<h3>Part II</h3> 
<p>The lines in this section are shorter, creating a quicker exchange between the jiutai and the shite and increasing the alternation in vocal texture between <em>tsuzuke utai</em> of the former and <em>mitsu-ji utai</em> of the latter. The text focuses on a celebration of the reign, one of the play’s three principal themes. At first, the <em>kata</em> are confined mainly to Square 1, but they then expand to cover much of the stage, matching the celebratory mood of the text.</p> 

<p>The shite advances to the front stage at Square 3, performing the Take the Corner <em>kata</em>. Remaining at the front of the stage, he moves to Square 5, then returns to Square 1, and finally walks to Square 9; in Measure 12, he scoops the left sleeve of his robe while referring to festive robes.</p> 

<h3>Part III</h3> 
<p>In the final section, the jiutai brings the play to a close with blessings as the shite presents a final round of dynamic, often mimetic <em>kata</em>. First, in Measure 13, he performs a Backing Point and a Right Circle <em>kata</em>, spreading his arms wide—a movement known in Bugaku for quelling demons. The following <em>kata</em> (Measures 15–16), as he speaks of arms that embrace blessings, involve opening the arms and then pulling them in, as if to collect and hold blessings. The text then references two dances from the Bugaku repertoire, both accompanied by upbeat music. The first, “Shenshu raku” (“Thousand Autumns”), is paired (in Measure 17) with seven stamps that mimetically illustrate the dancing, which the text describes as “a dance to bring joy.” The second, “Manzai raku” (“Ten Thousand Years”), features a temporary shift in the chant’s rhythmic setting from <em>hiranori</em> to the highly dynamic <em>chūnori</em>, in which all beats are densely filled with sung syllables. The text then refers one last time to the “pine couple,” using the affectionate term <em>aioi</em>—a moment emphasized by the nohkan’s highly expressive rendition of the <em>tome no takane</em> pattern. This final segment is decorated also by the ōtsuzumi with strong strokes on every other beat, giving the music a more dance-like feel.</p> 

<p>Normally, the shite would stamp twice to mark the end of a Noh performance. However, because this is a celebratory version of Takasago, especially following <em>Okina</em> (as in this recording), the shite performs three stamps, representing the auspicious Yang. At this point, the nohkan plays the <em>hishigi</em> pattern, which is typically not used during a conclusion. The high note adds energy and closure, while the shite swirls his left and right sleeves to further enhance the celebration. </p>
