  <p>This <em>Sashi</em> section is distinguished by the participation of the taiko, suggesting the presence of a supernatural being on stage, as its sound is well-suited for that role. This presence changes the typical rhythmic setting of <em>Sashi</em> from flexible to strict. The <em>shōdan</em> is highly energetic, with the tempo increasing in the second half, accompanied by the nohkan.</p>

<p>A unique scene unfolds in the final part of the chant, where the shite, embodying the god of Sumiyoshi, integrates the stage musicians into the dramatic world. In this fictional setting, the god commands the dancers at the Sumiyoshi shrine to perform a kagura dance, accompanied by drum beats from the musicians (measures 8-13). The shite strikes his hands twice while performing the Flap Fan <em>kata</em>—an action that opens and closes the arms as if encouraging the drumming—before executing a Twirl Sleeve and directly pointing to the musicians, using them to represent the fictional musicians in his narrative. Throughout this section, intense, strict rhythmic patterns led by the taiko illustrate also his final words: "(...) the drums in the night, with measured rhythm, soothe the god, celebrants of the shrine." This is further emphasized by a distinctive nohkan pattern called <em>notarnoryo</em>, which features a very low note.</p>
