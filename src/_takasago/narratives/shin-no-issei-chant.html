      ashirai. The nohkan is featured in both the initial section of the chant
      and the instrumental ashirai, maintaining a

      are chanted slowly by the shite and shitezure, while the middle section is

<p>The <em>shin no issei</em> chant demonstrates a rich interplay of vocal styles, movement, and staging conventions. The sequence begins as the shite (old man) and shitezure (old woman) sing together about the wind blowing through the pines as day draws to a close. Their singing is a slow, low-pitched <em>einori</em> chant, characterized by great expressive intensity and extended melismas. Facing each other, the actors’ bodies display deep attention and connection, and their performance is enhanced by the soulful sound of the <em>nohkan</em> flute.</p>

<p>As their duet concludes, the singing slows dramatically on extended melismatic notes. Just before the lyrics refer to the resonance of bells, the <em>nohkan</em> plays the <em>hibiki no te</em> ("resonance") pattern. The actors then turn to the front for the <em>ninoku</em> ("the second phrase"), a classical segment typical of two-actor <em>issei</em> chants in First Category plays. It provides a contrast that enriches the performance and enhances its celebratory character. The <em>shitezure</em> sings this part alone at a faster pace and higher pitch, exposed by the absence of the <em>nohkan</em> accompaniment. A two-measure percussion solo precedes her entrance, beginning slowly to create space before accelerating to set the new tempo. This contrast enhances the principal actor’s presence and emotional depth and is perceived as a celebration of Yin and Yang. This duality is further marked by their costumes, contrasting inflections of movement, and the way they carry their broom and rake—one directed up, the other down.</p>
<p>As the chant concludes, the <em>nohkan</em> re-enters to lead the instrumental <em>ashirai</em> section, during which both actors move to the main stage. The <em>shitezure</em> moves first and more quickly to Square 9, thereby preparing or "opening" the space and time for the <em>shite's</em> prominence. The <em>shite</em> follows at a slower pace to Square 1. Notably, the <em>shite</em> does not take the stronger position of Square 9 because it is customary for the principal actor to deliver his first song of the play from Square 1. He will occupy the whole stage, including Square 9, later in the performance.</p>
