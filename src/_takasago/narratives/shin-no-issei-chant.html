      The two actors face each other standing at the <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">3rd and 1st Pines</a>. They comment jointly on the gentle wind blowing through the pines as this spring day draws to a close. They then turn to the audience for the <em>ninoku</em>, during which the tsure sings about the waves reaching the shore. Once again facing each other, they reflect together on the regular, cyclical movement of ocean water as it ebbs and flows. The shōdan concludes with an Ashirai, as both actors enter the stage; the tsure moves to <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 6</a>, while the shite goes to <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>.
