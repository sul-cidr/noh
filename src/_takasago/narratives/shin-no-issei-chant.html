      The music is structured into four sections. First three are a <a href="/music/voices#Non-congurent" target="_blank"><em>non-congruent</em></a>  chant performed in <a href="/music/voices#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a>, utilizing the <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> style. Following these, there is a purely instrumental segment known as ashirai. The nohkan is featured in both the initial section of the chant and the instrumental ashirai, maintaining a <a href="/music/nohkan/#Non-congruent-Strict" target="_blank">non-congruent</a> setting throughout. In contrast, the percussion plays in a <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a> rhythmic setting during the chant but adopts the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> rhythmic setting during the ashirai segment. The first and third sections are chanted slowly by the shite and shitezure, while the middle section is performed more rapidly by the shitezure alone, on a higher pitch.

    The interaction of media in <em>Issei</em> is marked by a rich interplay of vocal styles, movement, and staging conventions. In the first section, the old man and woman comment together on the wind blowing through the pines as the day draws to a close. Their singing is characterized by great expressive intensity, performed slowly and in a lower pitch, with both actors facing each other, displaying through their bodies deep attention and connection, enhanced further by the soulful presence of the nohkan.
 </p>
  <p>
    Following this exchange, they turn to the front for the <em>ninoku</em>, a classical segment typical of an <em>Issei</em>Chant in First Category plays when two actors are present. It is meant to be contrasting and enriching to enhance the celebratory character of the plays. The shitezure sings the <em>ninoku</em> alone, at a faster pace and on a higher pitch, exposed by the absence of an accompaniment of the nohkan. This contrast enhances the principal actor’s presence and emotional depth, as well as be perceived as a the celebration of Yin and Yang. The latter is marked clearly by the costume, contrasting inlfection of movement, and the very way the actors carry their broom and rake - one directed down, the other up.
     </p>
  <p>
    As they conclude the chant, the nohkan reenters, leading into the instrumental <em>ashirai</em>, during which both actors make their way to the main stage. The shitezure moves first and somewhat faster to Square 9, followed by the shite, who proceeds at a slower pace to Square 1. As such, the shitezure prepares or "opens" the space and time for the shite's prominence. Notably, the shite does not move to the stronger position of Square 9, as it is customary for shite to sing for the first time in the play from Square 1. He will occupy the whole stage including Square 9 at a later time.
