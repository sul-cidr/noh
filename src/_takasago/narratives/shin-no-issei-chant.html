      The music is structured into four sections. First three are a <a href="/music/voices#Non-congurent" target="_blank"><em>non-congruent</em></a>  chant performed in <a href="/music/voices#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a>, utilizing the <a href="/music/voices#Tsuyogin" target="_blank"><em>tsuyogin</em></a> style. Following these, there is a purely instrumental segment known as ashirai. The nohkan is featured in both the initial section of the chant and the instrumental ashirai, maintaining a <a href="/music/nohkan/#Non-congruent-Strict" target="_blank">non-congruent</a> setting throughout. In contrast, the percussion plays in a <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">strict</a> rhythmic setting during the chant but adopts the <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> rhythmic setting during the ashirai segment. The first and third sections are chanted slowly by the shite and shitezure, while the middle section is performed more rapidly by the shitezure alone, on a higher pitch.

    The interaction of media in <em>Issei</em> is marked by a rich interplay of vocal styles, movement, and traditional staging conventions. In the first section, the old man and woman comment together on the gentle wind blowing through the pines as the day draws to a close. Their singing is characterized by great intensity, performed slowly and in a lower pitch, with both actors facing each other, displaying deep attention and connection enhanced by the soulful presence of the nohkan.
 </p>
  <p>
    Following this exchange, they turn to the audience for the ninoku, a classical contrasting segment typical of an <em>Issei</em>when two actors are present. During this section, the shitezure sings alone, at a faster pace and in a higher pitch, without the accompaniment of the nohkan, conveying an image of waves reaching the shore. After this, they return to facing each other as they contemplate the regular, cyclical movement of the ocean water as it ebbs and flows. As they conclude this chant, the nohkan reenters, leading into the instrumental <em>ashirai</em>, during which both actors make their way to the main stage. The shitezure moves first and somewhat faster to Square 9, followed slightly later by the shite, who proceeds to Square 1.
   </p>
  <p>
    This entrance is significant as the wakizure, as a secondary actor, prepares or "opens" the space for the main actor, the shite. The wakizure's movement serves as a progressive opening of the space that is echoed later during the <em>ashirai</em> as she walks to Square 9, which will eventually become the position of the shite. This movement contrasts with the shite’s slower entry, giving space for the shite's prominence, consistent with the tradition that the more important actor enters last. Notably, the shite does not move to the stronger position of Square 9, as is customary to begin singing from Square 1.
 </p> <p>
    The contrast found in the ninoku, where the shitezure sings at a higher, faster pace, is characteristic of First Category plays featuring two shite actors. This dynamic creates a celebratory and enriching effect that enhances the principal actor’s presence and emotional depth. In the context of the Takasago play, this contrast is especially significant, symbolizing the celebration of Yin and Yang. Even the way the actors carry their broom and rake, as well as the positioning of their hands, vividly expresses this theme of contrast.
