    While the <em>Nanori ‘s</em> narrative has set up a story that provides a
    reason for the shite to appear, the <em>Kakaru</em> increases momentum
    before his entrance. More prominent stage position, increased
    instrumentation, and changing style of vocal delivery raise the Intermedia
    Index. The elevated energy will be released with the shite’s appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The monk asserts the importance of the memorial service by moving to the
    center stage (Square 9). Coming from the energetically weaker Square 1, he
    opens up the stage space and activates one of the most powerful stage
    positions. Interestingly, the shite will not enter that area in the first
    act, limiting his actions to the quieter Squares 1 and 2.
  </p>

  <p>
    This <em>shōdan</em> also marks the first entry of the two hand-percussion
    instruments that accompany the non-congruent vocal part, with sparse
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji</em></a
    >
    patterns performed in flexible rhythmic setting.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the first three lines, the monk declares respect for the flowers,
    delivering his praises in <em>kotoba</em>. In the fourth one, he focuses
    specifically on the
    <time datetime="00:07:45.000" title="00:07:45">lotus</time>. In Buddhism,
    its ability to rise from murky waters to produce a beautiful and pure flower
    is a symbol of enlightenment. In Noh, the recitation of a sutra is always
    delivered in a sung fashion, thus the monk switches at that point from
    spoken to singing mode. He recites the Lotus Sutra:
    <em>sōmoku kokudo shi’kai jōbutsudō </em> (plants, trees, all on earth,
    achieve Buddhahood). The <em>sashinori</em> setting of the chant with its
    recitative style is well suited for the delivery of a religious text.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the scene, the monk performs a prayer gesture similar to the
    one used to close the <em>Nanori</em>. This time, it has a spiritual
    component as it is performed while the monk is singing the sutra. The monk
    joins
    <time datetime="00:08:32.000" title="00:08:32"
      >his open hands with rounded arms</time
    >
    unlike in <em>Nanori</em> when he kept
    <time datetime="00:06:29.000" title="nanori"
      >his fists closed and arms straight </time
    >. The separation of his hands at the end is always asymmetric.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is interesting to note that actors always stay in character. For
    instance, the
    <time datetime="00:09:01.000" title="09:01">motion of the sleeve</time> can
    be technically needed only to avoid wrinkling of the costume, but it is done
    'as a monk'.
