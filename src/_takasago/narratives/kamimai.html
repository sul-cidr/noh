  <p>The <em>Kamimai</em> dance intricately interweaves choreography with music. It is composed of six distinct sections, each accessible by clicking on their respective names below:</p>

<h3>Structure and Musical Patterns</h3>
<p>The form of <em>Kamimai</em> is cyclical, a quality articulated primarily through the repeated patterns played by the nohkan. These patterns are identified in the score below the video according to the following legend: Kakari – Ka; Chū – C; Kan – K; Kan no Chū – KC; Ryo – R; Oroshi – O; Dan – D; Tome – T.</p>

<p>Whereas a dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> is often structured around prominent mimetic <em>kata</em>, an instrumental dance does not adhere to this approach. Instead, specific structural <em>kata</em>—when paired with vocal calls from the percussion—fulfill distinct formal functions.</p>

<h3>Sectional Transitions and Kata</h3>
<p>For example, <em>kata</em> involving the fan, frequently accompanied by movements of the sleeves, are used to signal the anticipation or immediate commencement of a new section. The actual beginning of a <em>dan</em> is marked by one or two consecutive taiko’s kashira patterns, with the striking kakegoe "iya" serving to denote the first beat of the new section.</p>

<p>After performing the initial section, Kakari, with a closed fan, the shite signals the impending Sho-dan by opening the fan (1’27’37”), which is immediately followed by two kashira patterns. A Fan Reverse Hold and a Right Sleeve Swirl (1’28’32”) indicate the beginning of Ni-dan, synchronized with the first of two kashira patterns. Subsequently, shifting the fan to the left hand (1’29’32”) precedes the start of San-dan, which is marked by two kashira patterns. The onset of Yon-dan is announced by swirling both sleeves and returning the fan to the right hand in a reverse hold (1’30’35”), followed by two kashira patterns. Finally, Go-dan begins with a single kashira pattern, and the resetting of both sleeves along with the fan’s return to the right hand signifies the dance’s closing section.</p>

<h3>Endings Within Sections</h3>
<p>While fan movements typically denote the commencement of a section, <em>kata</em> also serve to mark their conclusion. For instance, a Left–Right stamping sequence—followed by a closing <em>kata</em> such as an Open-Retreat or a Scooping Point—is frequently employed for this purpose. This closing sequence is commonly performed three <em>honji</em> before the onset of the subsequent section, as observed at the conclusion of Kakari (1’27’31”), Sho-dan (1’28’23”), and Ni-dan (1’29’23”). For the closure of San-dan (1’30’32”), the Scooping Point is substituted with a Sweeping Point. In Yon-dan (1’31’01”), the two stamping movements are separated by three <em>kata</em>: Take the Corner, Circlet, and Swirled Left Sleeve. The final Go-dan (1’31’40”) is concluded with a single Right Stamp.</p>

<h3>Use of Stage Space and Choreographic Modularity</h3>
<p>Differences in stage space utilization further reinforce the six-section structure of the dance. The use of stage space in Kakari is particularly noteworthy. Here, the nohkan player introduces a core sequence of patterns known as Ji, which he repeats three times, while the shite opens the stage. Holding a closed fan in his right hand, the shite first moves from the back of the stage (Square 8) to the front (Square 3), then traverses the front stage (Squares 3 to 5), and finally moves transversally left-right from Square 5 to Square 1.</p>

<p>This trajectory not only opens the stage space but also creates a spatial wave of tension and release. Positions further from the audience, such as Square 8, are generally seen as locations of released tension and are often used as starting and closing points for dances and their individual sections. In contrast, front-stage positions (Squares 3, 4, 5, and the center-stage Square 9), which are closer to the audience, are considered positions of strength. Thus, the initial movement from Square 8 to Square 3 builds momentum, transitioning the shite from a relaxed state to one of increased tension. The shift from Square 3 to Square 5 maintains this momentum, keeping the dancer at the forefront, while the final move from Square 5 to Square 1 releases tension as the shite returns from the front stage to the back.</p>

<p>The choreography of Kakari also exemplifies the modular nature of Noh. Similar stage space usage is observed in two other instrumental dances featured on this website: the Kakari of the slow and elegant Jonomai, and the first section of the dynamic and vigorous Maibataraki from Kokaji.</p>

<p>While Kakari, characterized by overall back-front-back movement, expands the use of the stage, the choreography of Sho-dan restricts movement to the middle lateral (Squares 2 – 9 – 6), clearly contrasting with Ni-dan, where action is limited to the middle front-back (Squares 8 – 9 – 4). Notably, during the six-honji long oroshi, stage movement ceases, and the shite, standing on Square 1, performs a sequence of head <em>kata</em>. The action of Yon-dan primarily takes place at the rear of the stage (Square 8). Lastly, in Go-dan, a variation on the back–front–back motion is employed, with the shite concluding on Square 9 and holding the kamae position, thereby signifying the conclusion of the dance.</p>
    <p>
        In the performance of the nohkan, the pitch system of the melody does not align with the absolute pitch system used in other forms of Japanese instrumental music, such as Gagaku. However, the terms <strong>ōshiki</strong> and <strong>banshiki</strong> hold significant importance in nohkan practice. Nohkan players use these terms to refer to different fingering patterns while performing identical melodic patterns, such as the <em>Ji</em> pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the <em>Ji</em> pattern is played using the <strong>ōshiki</strong> fingering pattern, the central note of the melody is approximately G. In contrast, when the same melody is played using the <strong>banshiki</strong> fingering pattern, the player opens more finger holes, raising the central note to approximately A, which is about two degrees higher. Although the exact sound of the melody varies with each fingering pattern, the overall contour (the up and down pattern of the notes) remains identical. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Interestingly, the pitch name <strong>banshiki</strong> is associated with water in the Chinese Yinyang and Five Element system. Therefore, a nohkan player, under the supervision of the shite actor, decided to perform the entire section of the Kamimai dance using <strong>banshiki</strong> fingerings. While the melody of Kamimai is not always played in <strong>banshiki</strong>, this particular performance coincided with the celebration of a university's campus relocation, prompting the choice as it is widely believed that its use serves as a form of protection against fire for the new buildings on campus. Appropriately for the celebration it also produces a considerably brighter sound compared to <strong>ōshiki</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the entire <em>Kamimai</em> dance transitions to <strong>banshiki</strong>, the melody of the <em>oroshi</em> becomes different and longer than the standard <em>Kamimai</em>. Notably, the <em>oroshi</em> of the third <em>dan</em> typically consists of 4 segments, but in this instance, the nohkan player performed six segments across six measures (measure 57-62). During these segments, the nohkan player produced the <em>hishigi</em> note three times, adding brightness and vividness.
