  In a typical Takasago performance, this chant appears at the beginning of the play, preceded by <em>Shinno shidai</em> music. In this case, however, there is only a short six-measure fragment of <em>Shidai</em>> music played, which is there for the actors to walk to their positions on stage: the waki on the right facing the attendants on the left. Traditionally, <em>Shidai</em> chant consists of the text being sung three times: first by the waki and wakizure, then very softly, omitting the repetition of the first line, by the jiutai, and finally once again by the waki and wakizure. The first two are done using <em>mitsuji</em> patterns in the percussion, leading to the third, which has an increased energy of the <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns.
