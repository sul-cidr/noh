  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> centers on the reign, one of the principal themes of the play. More specifically, the text focuses on peace and the eternity of the reign, evoking a “calm wind” that softly blows over the four seas and the pine trees. <em>Ageuta 2</em>—together with the final parts of the <em>Rongi</em> 2—has been one of the most emblematic chants for celebratory occasions since the 17th century, including the Edo shogunate’s New Year rituals. It is still performed by all Noh schools as the first song of the New Year.</p> <p>Because celebration is traditionally associated with directness, this <em>Ageuta</em> is sung at the fastest tempo among the chants. To avoid slowing the pace, it omits both the repetition of the first line and the insertion of an <em>uchikiri</em> at the outset. Although the final line is repeated for emphasis, the opening is exceptional in its unbroken forward momentum.</p> 
<p>The stage movment helps deliniate the text. After the shite proceeds to Square 4, during the line <em>aioi no matsu</em> (“paired pine tree”), he performs an Open-retreat <em>kata</em> to indicate and contemplate the paired pines. He then turns left, moves to Square 1 and then 2, and executes another Open-retreat that this time throws a strong spotlight on <em>kimi no megumi</em> (“the sovereign’s blessing”), sung twice as the final line is repeated. In this fast section, two focal points stand out: the first Forward Point and Open-retreat signal his attention to the paired pines; the second set highlights the auspicious sovereign.</p> 
 <p>As is typical in the second half of an <em>Ageuta</em>, the nohkan enters with the <em>naka no takane</em> pattern. Together with the text, this heightens the emotional character of the segment and marks the customary shift from presenting new information to amplifying affect.</p> <p>Besides the brief <em>jitori</em> in the <em>shidai</em>, this shōdan marks the first substantial entrance of the <em>jiutai</em>. In fact, <em>Ageuta</em> 2 is the first shōdan they carry on their own, singing at full strength.</p>
