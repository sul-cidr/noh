      After an extended musical introduction, the curtain raises, and the shite and the shitezure enter the stage. They stop at the <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">3rd and 1st Pines</a>, respectively, where they face each other. The shite, representing Suminoe, appears as an old man, while the tsure, representing Takasago, appears as an old woman. The shite carries a rake, and the tsure carries a broom, symbolizing their enduring love and long life together.

<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <p>This is the beginning of the Shite Enters dan, the entrance music that brings the shite and <em>shite-zure</em> onto the stage. Compared with the preceding Waki Enters dan, the overall tempo is very slow. It conveys the solemnity of a First Category play and befits the characters of the <em>shite</em> and <em>shitezure</em>, an aged man and woman. </p>

  <p>The <em>Shin-no issei</em> Music—a high-ranked form of <em>Issei</em> Music—comprises five parts: <br><strong><em>Kakari</em></strong> (start), <br><strong><em>Nagashi</em></strong>, <br><strong><em>Yatsugashira</em></strong>, <br><strong><em>Makuage-no-dan</em></strong>, and <br><strong><em>Shizume-gashira</em></strong>. </p>
  
  <h4>Kakari</h4>
  <p> In <strong><em>Kakari</em></strong>, TBD........... </p>
  
  <h5>Nagashi-Yatsugashira</h5>
<p> <em>Nagashi</em> and <em>Yatsugashira</em> are always performed together in that order, forming an extended variant of the original second part, <em>Koshi-no-dan</em>. These sections are played exclusively by the two drums—the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi—with the nohkan silent to spotlight the percussion. <em>Nagashi</em> features an ōtsuzumi’s sequence of strong strokes (measures 10–11), while <em>Yatsugashira</em> highlights forceful <em>kashira</em> strokes by both drums (measures 16–20). Although “eight” (<em>yatsu</em>) appears in the name, the audience may not be able to distinguish that number since more than eight <em>kashira</em> are articulated; the label’s ceremonial and auspicious sense matters more than a literal count. Notably, <em>Nagashi–Yatsugashira</em> appears as a <em>kogaki</em> (“added name”) on programs, signaling a high-ranked treatment. </p>
  
  <h3>Makuage-no-dan</h3>
  <p>The word <em>makuage</em> means 'open the curtain'. During <em>Makuage-no-dan</em> (measures 22–28), the curtain rises and the shite’s party enters: unlike the waki, who always precedes his wakizure, the shitezure< appears first and walks ahead of the shite. The flow of the music matches the steps of the actors and then slows down to prepare for the closing section. </p>
  
  <h3><em>Shizume-gashira</em><h/3>
  <p>As <em>Shizume-gashira</em> (measures 29–30) emerges from the slow-down, it culminates in measure 30 where the ōtsuzumi strikes strong <em>kashira</em> on beats 1, 3, and 5, matched by the shite and shitezure with three small steps—left, right, left. This auspicious odd-number motif returns at the play’s close, when the shite stamps left, right, left to finish. The kotsuzumi player closes this section with two high-pitched strokes (beats 6-and-a-half and 7 in measure 31). These strokes create a stillness that set the stage for the aged man and woman as they will express their poetic emotion through chanting.</p>
