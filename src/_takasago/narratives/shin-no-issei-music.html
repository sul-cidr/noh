      After an extended musical introduction, the curtain raises, and the shite and the shitezure enter the stage. They stop at the <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">3rd and 1st Pines</a>, respectively, where they face each other. The shite, representing Suminoe, appears as an old man, while the tsure, representing Takasago, appears as an old woman. The shite carries a rake, and the tsure carries a broom, symbolizing their enduring love and long life together.

  <p>This is the first <em>shōdan</em> of the <em>Shite Enters dan</em>, the entrance piece that brings the shite and <em>shite-zure</em> onto the stage; it is purposefully cast in contrasting music to introduce especially mysterious figures. </p>

  <p>The <em>Shin-no issei</em>—a high-ranked form of <em>Issei</em>—comprises five parts: <br><strong><em>Kakari</em></strong> (start), <br><strong><em>Nagashi</em></strong>, <br><strong><em>Yatsugashira</em></strong>, <br><strong><em>Makuage-no-dan</em></strong>, and <br><strong><em>Shizume-gashira</em></strong>. </p>
  
  <p> In <strong><em>Kakari</em></strong>, the tempo contrasts sharply with the waki’s preceding <em>Shidai</em> and <em>Michiyuki</em>, unfolding very slowly and calmly to convey the solemnity of a First Category play and to suit the aged man and woman (shite and <em>shitezure</em>). </p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Nagashi</em></strong> and <strong><em>yatsugashira</em></strong> together form an extended variant of the original second part, <em>koshi-no-dan</em>, which is played exclusively by the two drums; as multiple <em>koshi-no-dan</em> variants are tied to specific plays, the choice here foreshadows the characters to come. In this version, <em>Nagashi</em> features the <em>otsuzumi</em>’s special sequence of strong strokes (measures 10–11), while <strong><em>yatsugashira</em></strong> highlights forceful <em>kashira</em> strokes by both <em>otsuzumi</em> and <em>kotsuzumi</em> (measures 16–20). Although “eight” (<em>yatsu</em>) is in the name, listeners may just hear many of such strokes; the label’s ceremonial weight matters more than a literal count. </p>
  
  <p>Notably, <em>Nagashi–Yatsugashira</em> appears as a <em>kogaki</em> (“added name”) on programs, signaling a high-ranked treatment. During <strong><em>Makuage-no-dan</em></strong> (measures 22–28), the curtain rises and the shite’s party enters: unlike the waki, who always precedes his <em>wakizure</em>, the <em>tsure</em> appears first and walks ahead of the shite; the <em>Shin-no issei</em> serves as their entrance music as the <em>tsure</em> stops at the first pine and faces the shite at the third. </p>
  
  <p>Finally, <strong><em>shizume-gashira</em></strong> (measures 29–30) emerges from a further ritard, culminating in measure 30 where the <em>otsuzumi</em> strikes strong <em>kashira</em> on beats 1, 3, and 5, matched by the shite and <em>shitezure</em> with three small steps—left, right, left. This auspicious odd-number motif returns at the play’s close, when the shite stamps left, right, left to finish.</p>
