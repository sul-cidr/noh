    This dynamic entrance music announces the arrival of a powerful character.
    In the case of Takasago, it heralds the God of Sumiyoshi. The
    <em>deha</em> features a non-congruent nohkan part accompanied by the three
    percussion instruments in a strict rhythmic setting. This is the first
    <em>shōdan</em> of the second act to include the full <em>hayashi</em>. The
    Intermedia Index rises as the <em>shōdan</em> continues to elevate the
    play’s energy level.
  </p>

  <p>
    The taiko part introduces five cycles of patterns that follow the standard
    sequence: Head, First Transition, Ground, Second Transition, and Closing. In
    the first four cycles, the number of measures allocated to the Head pattern
    decreases while the number of measures assigned to the other four segments
    remains unchanged: one for First Transition, three for Ground, one for
    Second Transition, and one for Closing. The distribution of measures changes
    for the fifth cycle, which essentially serves as a transitional phrase
    leading to the next <em>shōdan</em>. The following table identifies the
    functional patterns occurring in each measure:

    Twice the nohkan joins the percussion trio, each time entering during the
    first measure of a group of Ground patterns: the first time at measure 9
    until 13, the second time at measure 34 until the end coinciding with the
    opening of the curtain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pattern commencing at measure 9 can be divided into two parts: the first
    part consists of the same opening pattern used in the <em>issei</em> music
    (beginning at measure 24), which concludes with a variant of the
    <em>takane hane</em> pattern. The pattern beginning at measure 34 is a
    variation of the second pattern also found in the <em>issei</em> music (also
    beginning at measure 24), followed by a cadential pattern played in the
    instrument’s lower register.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning of the nohkan's second entry, the curtain rises, and the
    shite makes his entrance onto the bridge. He immediately turns and faces
    front, performing the dynamic Figure Eight <em>kata</em> that showcases his
    divine stature. He then proceeds to the First Pine, delaying his entrance
    onto the main stage as he first turns to face front and then executes the
    standard sequence of kata: Forward Point and Open-retreat.

  <p>
    It should be noted that the information provided above pertains specifically
    to the performance of this <em>deha</em>, which has been adapted for this
    special occasion. In Japanese culture, odd numbers are generally considered
    auspicious, symbolizing harmony and completeness, a concept reflected in the
    number of <em>kashira</em> patterns performed during the Head section of
    each cycle: seven in the first cycle, five in the second, three in the
    third, two in the fourth, and finally one in the last cycle.
