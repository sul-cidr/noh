    The end of the preceding 'Waki Enters' <em>dan</em> has set the scene for
    the arrival of the main actor. The chanting has ceased and the waki has left
    center-stage for his post on Square 5. The shite’s entrance music starts
    with the percussion instruments in flexible mode, performing a slow music
    composed of sparse
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji</em></a
    >
    patterns. It is at the second <em>honji</em> that the nohkan joins them with
    a variation of the non-congruent
    <a href="/music/nohkan/rokunoge" target="_blank"><em>roku no ge</em></a>
    pattern. The haunting, very slow and free-flowing melody with limited
    ornamentation, sets a humble yet refined tone evocative of enigmatic beauty.
    As if "summoned" by the music, the main character appears slowly, seemingly
    out of nowhere. The absence of periodic pulsations creates an unsettling
    feeling, which matches the spirit of a dream or otherworldly appearance.

    The timing, gesture and expression of the curtain lifting depends on the
    shite's cue. After waiting for the right moment, the way the shite utters
    <em>omaku</em> suggests to the stage assistant the manner in which the
    lifting is to be executed. In the featured performance, the shite waited
    until the third <em>honji</em>, providing the music with ample time to set
    the proper mood.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the shite enters the bridge, the curtain goes down as slowly as it was
    lifted. The actor walks very slowly, taking two minutes to reach the First
    Pine. His appearance is gradual. At first, the mask can solely be seen from
    the profile. Only as the shite is about to sing and the entrance music comes
    to an end,
    <time datetime="00:12:23.000" title="00:12:23">does he turn </time> toward
    the audience, thus revealing the mask in full-face. Not having entered the
    stage proper may imply that the apparition still remains invisible to the
    monk.
