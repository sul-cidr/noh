      The jiutai and the old man discuss the relationship between nature and
      poetry. They begin with the words of Chōnō, who remarked that both
      sentient and insentient things in nature conceal feelings and embody
      poetry.

      The shite, kneeling at

      faces front but slides to the left to face the waki when the text
      references various sentient and insentient things, asking, 'Do they not
      embody poetry?' He slides a second time to face the waki as the text
      praises the virtues of Emperor Shikō. After delivering the <em>ageha</em>,
      the shite stands up and performs various mimetic kata related to the sung
      text.

  <p>Intermedia analysis</p>
  <p>
    The dance divides the <em>shōdan</em> into two parts: the kneeling part and
    the standing part, which begins at the <em>ageha</em>. The text focuses on
    Takasago and celebrates poetry, one of the play’s central themes.
  </p>
  <h3>Sitting part</h3>
  <p>
    An <em>uchikiri</em> divides this section into two sub-parts. The first
    consists of three phrase-waves: <em>tori</em> – <em>mitsu-ji</em> –
    <em>tsuzuke</em>, which lead up to the <em>uchikiri</em>. This structure
    creates waves of increasing momentum. It begins with a <em>tori</em> (a
    four-beat measure), followed by a <em>mitsu-ji</em> (an eight-beat measure
    with only a few stroked beats), and then a <em>tsuzuke</em> (another
    eight-beat measure, this time with most beats stroked). The gradually
    increasing number of pulsated beats, along with the accelerated tempo, gives
    the music an energetic feel suited to the text’s celebratory tone.
  </p>
  <p>
    The text centers on the theme of poetry, enumerating various insentient
    entities such as plants, trees, and the elemental sounds of wind and
    waves—several of which bear a strong relationship to poetic expression, as
    exemplified by terms like So-o-mo-ku-do-sha (grass, wood, soil, sand) and
    fu-u-sei-su-i-on (voice of wind and sound of water). The text also employs a
    distinctive technique to foreground particular words: the four-beat measure
    known as <em>tori</em>. For instance, the phrase ha-ru-no ha-ya-shi-no,
    consisting of seven syllables, is distributed across two <em>tori</em>.
    Given that a single one can accommodate up to eight syllables, the sixteen
    available positions in two <em>tori</em> allow for intentional pauses
    between words, thereby enhancing their emphasis. In this context, the
    respective words for “spring” and “forest” are further accentuated through
    the application of the nohkan’s <em>naka no takane</em> pattern. This
    process of enumeration and emphasis culminates in the central question: “Do
    they not embody poetry?” The play’s thematic focus on poetry is further
    underscored when the shite turns to the left to face the waki while posing
    this question.
  </p>
  <p>
    The nohkan’s <em>naka no takane</em> pattern marks the beginning of the
    second half, which introduces a similar sequence of phrase-waves. This time,
    the text focuses on the Takasago pine tree. Following an enumeration of its
    most remarkable attributes, the shite once again slides left to face the
    waki as the jiutai, speaking for him, states, “All praise its virtues.” This
    statement is further underlined by the nohkan’s
    <em>mi roku no ge</em> pattern.
  </p>
  <h3>Standing part</h3>
  <p>
    This part begins with the shite’s <em>ageha</em>. It is characterized by a
    sudden change in vocal density—from eight voices to one—a sharp decrease in
    tempo, and a shift in the text, which now describes the landscape
    surrounding the magnificent Takasago tree. The return of the jiutai as lead
    singer is emphasized by the nohkan’s hishigi takane mi kusari pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the text alludes to the pine’s fallen leaves, the shite performs the
    ‘raking the leaves’ <em>kata</em>. According to the philologist Dr. Setauko
    Otani, this gesture also symbolizes the prosperity of the reign but also the
    prosperity of poetry that should be regarded as parallel with the eternity
    of the reign. In other words, at this point, text and <em>kata</em> bring in
    synchronicity two of the play’s three celebrated themes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the third phrase-wave, the deep green color of the leaves is said to
    symbolize a long-lasting reign, referencing one of the play’s main topics.
    Approaching its conclusion, the text introduces praise for Takasago and
    reverence for the ‘Twin Paired’, one of the play’s three honored themes. In
    the fourth phrase-wave, the shite moves away from center stage for the first
    time in the <em>shōdan</em>, going to Square 1. Having captured our
    attention, he performs a Right circlet, a Forward point, and an Open-retreat
    as the jiutai sings: “Among ever-green trees, the name of Takasago stands
    out…”, returning the <em>shōdan</em>’s focus to its main subject, Takasago.
  </p>
  <p>
    The shite then returns to Square 9, kneeling and facing the waki as the
    jiutai sings, “…through generations its paired pines are the image of this
    blessing,” a praise of the ‘Twin Pines’ emphasized by the shite’s stage
    motion, the nohkan’s <em>mi roku no ge</em> pattern, and two percussionists,
    who bring the <em>shōdan</em> to a close with a two-measure
    <em>uchikiri</em>.
