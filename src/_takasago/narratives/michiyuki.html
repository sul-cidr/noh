    Hashitomi’s shite is a young and elegant lady, so his slow exit is well in
    character. He exits the stage in silence, according to the tradition in the
    Morita School of nohkan featured here. However, when the shite is a deity,
    as it is the case in <a href="/kokaji/raijo/" target="_blank">Kokaji</a>,
    his exit is accompanied by music.
