  <p>
    This <em>shōdan</em> is essentially an <em>ageuta</em>, but with an
    unusually energetic character suited to a traveling song. It follows the
    traditional <em>ageuta</em> design by beginning with a line that is then
    repeated, separated by a percussion <em>uchikiri</em>; here it is sung in
    unison by the waki and wakizure, while the nohkan enhances the first
    <em>uchikiri</em> (measures 3–4) with a special
    <em>Takane hishigi</em> pattern that includes a high <em>hishigi</em> note,
    evoking a peaceful voyage across the sea. The opening <em>tori</em>, with
    its truncated first line, further propels the sense of motion.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the second half, unlike most <em>ageuta</em>, the
    <em>mitsuji</em> pattern appears only once and gives way to a continuous
    <em>tsuzuke</em>; instead of a contrasting <em>uchikiri</em> to reset the
    tempo, the second <em>uchikiri</em> (measure 9) uses a special pattern that
    articulates every beat and adds energetic vocal calls (<em>kake-goe</em>),
    driving the subsequent vocal lines (measure 10 ff.) with even greater
    momentum. This heightened musical energy aligns with the waki’s stage
    movements: a sequence of <em>kata</em> culminating in the demonstrative
    gesture “Catch the Front,” followed by a strong foot-stamping pattern known
    as <em>tsukiashi</em>, which signals arrival at the shore of Takasago. The
    customary repetition of the final line reinforces the sense of arrival
    poetically and musically.
