   <p>Music plays a crucial role in all <em>Kuri</em>, the first of a three-<em>shōdan</em> structure, in which it is traditionally likened to the flow of water from a vigorous waterfall into the slower stream of the <em>Sashi</em> and finally to a tranquil pond in <em>Kuse</em>. <em>Kuri</em> showcases a great variety of fast-paced patterns, which can make it challenging to follow the text. All <em>Kuri</em>, including this one, conclude with <em>yuri</em> patterns of the nohkan, which, like the chanting in the final segment, are repetitive and melismatic, and create a feeling of extension or slowdown—even when the overall tempo remains active. Here, this is accompanied by the shite, who sets down the rake and takes out the fan as a signal that he is about to shift into a narrative mode. Together, the music and movement establish a smooth transition to the slower and more narratively perceptible <em>Sashi</em> that follows.</p> <p>In the first category and other auspicious plays at higher <em>kurai</em>, the entrance of the jiutai is delayed after two or three <em>honji</em> to build anticipation and emphasize the importance of the <em>Kuri</em>.</p>
