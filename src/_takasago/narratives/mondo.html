      In this dialogue, the priest asks why the Takasago and Suminoe pines are
      considered a "pair," despite being geographically distant from one
      another. In response, the old man refers to them as the "Paired Pines," a
      term inspired by the preface of the <em>Kokinshu</em>, contemporary to the
      action, early Heian period anthology of waka poetry.

      respectively, while the waki stands at
      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, facing the
      shite. The dialogue occurs exclusively between the shite and the waki,
      with the shite turning toward the waki when responding to his questions.
      While singing about the Takasago pine, he slides slightly in front-left
      direction.

  <p>
    This very simple scene features a dialogue between two characters with
    minimal motion and no music. However, it conveys a meaningful contrast in
    age and implied status: the god character sings in a lower pitch and slower
    tempo, while the waki speaks in a faster, more natural style.
