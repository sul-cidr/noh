    <div class="section-introduction__definition">In this dialogue, the priest asks the old man why the Takasago and Suminoe pines are regarded as a “pair” despite being far apart. The old man explains that they are called <em>aioi matsu</em> (“Coupled Pines”), a term from the preface to the <em>Kokinshū</em>, the early Heian anthology of waka poetry contemporary with the play’s setting. We also learn that the old man and woman are themselves a couple: she is from Takasago Shrine, and he is from Suminoe. </div>

The dialogue occurs exclusively between the shite and the waki, with the shite turning toward the waki when responding to his questions. While singing about the Takasago pine, he slides slightly in front-left direction. Toward the end, he turns to the old woman to ask whether she has anything to add.

  <p>
   This very simple scene features a dialogue between two characters with minimal motion and no music. However, it conveys a meaningful contrast in age and implied status: the god character sings in a lower pitch and slower tempo, while the priest speaks in a faster, more natural style.
