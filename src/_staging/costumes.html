          Noh costumes define a characterʼs gender, profession, and rank. Their
          layered elements are prescribed by tradition and can be found noted at
          the beginning of the <em>utaibon</em> (libretto). While the types of
          garments for a given play are regulated, their colors, patterns, and
          in some cases mimetic techniques serve as a tool for the actorʼs
          expression. In choosing the costume for a character the actor
          considers the image to be portrayed, the overall atmophere of the
          performance, and the balance of colors, patterns, and motif sizes as
          they play off the costumes of other characters. The performer usually
          has a stock of costumes from which to choose. Heads of schools and
          other actor families that own theaters as well as some individual
          actors have costumes collected over a long time span.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noh costumes can be divided into four basic categories: (1)
          <em><strong>kosode</strong></em> “small-sleeved”, T-shaped,
          straight-lined, full-length garments similar to a modern kimono, with
          wrist-length sleeves that have their cuff edge sewn up half way to
          form a pocket. (2) <em><strong>ōsode</strong></em> or
          <em><strong>hirosode</strong></em> “broad-sleeved” outer garments. The
          various styles of <em>ōsode</em> outer garments all have extra wide
          sleeves, often double the weaving width, that are open at the cuff.
          These are worn over a <em>kosode</em> and are generally three-quarter
          length. (3) <em><strong>hakama</strong></em
          >, variously translated as trousers, pleated pants, or divided skirts
          depending on how voluminous they are. (4)
          <strong>accessories</strong>, including hairbands
          (<em>kazura-obi</em>), waist sashes (<em>koshi-obi</em>), head covers
          like crowns, hats, and helmets, and hand-held objects such as fans,
          prayer beads, weapons, sticks, and ritual objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Note: the garments are listed by their Japanese names followed by an
          English description in parenthesis and then a semicolon. After the
          semicolon comes a description of the specific garment used for this
          production.]

        <p>
          The stipulated costume for this role is the standard for young women
          appearing in the first act of a nō, certain details, however, hint at
          a high status.

          Some of the costumes seen in Hashitomi and Kokaji are used for several
          roles, but draped differently. For instance, the <em>chōken</em> falls
          freely when draped on a woman who dances (Hashitomi act II). The cords
          are tied in a large bow knot over the chest. On the other hand, the
          <em>chōken</em> is belted when draped on a man, as for the costume of
          the waki in the second act (Kokaji act II). The cords run vertically
          and are securely knotted to the waist sash.
        </p>

          The <em>mizugoromo</em> is worn over a <em>kosode</em> for the waki
          monk in Hashitomi and by the shite in act I of Kokaji, though the type
          of <em>kosode</em> differs, as do the hair and hat, creating different
          impressions overall. For the kyōgen in Kokaji, however, the
          <em>mizugoromo</em> is draped over the pantaloon-like
          <em>kukuri-bakama</em>.

          Brocaded <em>kosode</em> come in two forms: <em>karaori</em> and
          <em>atsuita</em>. While the karaori can be worn either as an outer
          (i.e. the shite in act I of Hashitomi) or an inner garment under a
          broad-sleeved garment, the <em>atsuita</em> is generally an
          undergarment worn by male characters under various types of
          broad-sleeved over garments. When one of the sleeves of the over
          garment is slipped off, the <em>atsuita</em> pattern is exposed more
          fully. The waki in Kokaji act II removes the right sleeve of the
          <em>chōken</em> in preparation for working on the sword.

          act II), the sleeves of the <em>chōken</em> are flipped over the arms
          to intensify given moments
