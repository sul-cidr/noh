        <h2 id="Masks">Masks</h2>
        <p><em>By Diego Pellecchia</em></p>
        <h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          There are over 200 types of noh masks, grouped in categories, types,
          and variant types. One of the most common subdivisions conceives of
          five groups: god masks, female masks, male masks, spirit masks, and
          demon masks. Masks used in the ritual performance
          <em>Okina</em> constitute an additional category. Kyōgen masks are
          categorized separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most noh masks are associated with a character type (e.g. young woman,
          middle-aged woman, warrior, demon, etc.) and each shite school may
          prescribe a certain character in a specific play to be performed with
          different types of mask. There are only a few masks that are used
          exclusively to portray one character (e.g. <em>Yamamba</em>,
          <em>Shunkan</em>, <em>Semimaru</em>). Also, while most mask types are
          employed across schools, some others are specific to certain schools.
          For example, the same role of young woman may be portrayed with a
          woman mask called Waka-onna (Kanze school), Fushiki-zō (Hōshō school),
          Magojirō or Ko-omote (Kongō school), or Ko-omote (Konparu and Kita
          schools).
        </p>

        <p>
          Masks developed throughout the Muromachi period (1338-1573), and their
          use was canonized at the beginning of the 17th century. In the late
          16th century, certain masks from each type were seen as superior and
          became standards (<em>honmen</em>) that were then copied using
          techniques that are still used today. Each of these
          <em>honmen</em> has a name (e.g. Kojō, Chūjō, Tobide), which is
          retained as the name of the copy (<em>utsushi</em>), thus establishing
          identifiable iconography for each name-type. Excellent
          <em>utsushi</em> masks made according to the dimensions and expression
          of the <em>honmen</em> became viable theatrical tools and are seen as
          having their own intrinsic identity. As <em>honmen</em> are used as
          reference masks, the process of creating <em>utsushi</em> naturally
          results in the creation of a great number of spin-off masks, expanding
          the range of choice in the portrayal of a character.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noh masks are carved using only natural materials and hand tools. A
          single block of <em>hinoki</em> (Japanese cypress) is carved into the
          shape of the mask, then it is covered with a white primer made with
          crushed shell and animal glue. The mask is then painted with natural
          pigments and, depending on the type, is covered with thin layers of
          brownish paint which create a patina of age while giving depth and
          highlighting details. Finally, the carver may deliberately scratch or
          scar parts of the mask to give it an ‘older’ look. No fixing agent or
          varnish is added on top of the mask, making it prone to further
          damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today both ancient masks and copies are used in performance.
          Regardless of age, actors treat masks with the utmost care, bowing to
          them before using them in performance to express respect for the
          tradition they represent. It is thanks to this carefulness that
          ancient masks can still be used on stage today, after centuries of
          use.

        <h4>Mask: ‘Ko-omote’</h4>
        <p>
          The name of this type of mask means ‘small face’. The use varies
          depending on the shite school. Kongō school uses Ko-omote to portray
          any kind of young female character: from a country girl to a court
          lady, from a flower spirit to a goddess.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ko-omote represents the idealized face of an aristocratic young woman
          from the Heian period (794-1185), which was considered as the standard
          of elegance in medieval Japan. Ko-omote masks feature a fair
          complexion, with three thick hairlines neatly combed along the sides
          and fuzzy eyebrows painted high on the forehead. The teeth are dyed
          black. This make-up and hairstyle follow Heian-period aesthetics,
          though the mask may be used to portray any kind of female character,
          even from later eras. The mask’s plump cheeks and small lips, and the
          proportions of the small triangle formed between the eyes, nose and
          mouth give the mask a youthful look.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Ko-omote2.png"
        %}

        <p>
          The mask is used in combination with a, long black wig
          (<em>kazura</em>) which, in the case of Hashitomi, is kept bound
          behind the neck, and hidden under the upper garment. The hair wig is
          parted in the middle and combed along the sides of the face, in
          correspondence with the painted hair. The ears of the actor are hidden
          under the hair.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of Hashitomi, Ko-omote is the standard choice in the Kongō
          school to represent the face of Yūgao, a young aristocratic lady from
          the Heian period. The Kanze school uses Waka-onna, offering the
          alternatives of Ko-omote and Fukai, the mask of a middle-aged woman.
          The Hōshō school uses its standard young woman mask, Fushikizō.
        </p>
        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Ko-omote1.png"
        %}
        <p>
          Shimo-gakari shite schools (Konparu, Kongō, and Kita) schools use
          Ko-omote for both shite and tsure (companion) roles, though they often
          distinguish between specific Ko-omote masks reserving certain ones for
          shite roles and assigning others with less complex expressions for
          tsure roles. The Kongō school treasures one of the most famous
          Ko-omote masks, called Yuki-no-Ko-omote (snow Ko-omote), which is said
          to have been created by the renown mask carver Tatsuemon in the
          Muromachi period (1338-1573).

        <h4>First Act Mask: ‘Dōji’</h4>

        <p>
          The name of this mask means ‘boy’. The mask is used invariably for
          either a deity or a spirit in disguise in the first half of a play
          (e.g. <em>Tamura</em>, <em>Kokaji</em>, <em>Shakkyō</em>) or for roles
          of Chinese immortal (<em>Makura-jidō</em>, <em>Hōsō</em>, etc.).
          According to nō conventions, masks are not used for roles of adult
          males, unless the character is the personification of a supernatural
          creature or some other kind of special character.
        </p>
        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Doji3.png" %}
        <p>
          The mask represents the face of a boy, with natural eyebrows,
          elongated eyes, and a natural smile. The expression is devoid of any
          wrinkle or furrows, contributing to a youthful look. The painted
          uncombed hair suggests a young age and is matched with the large black
          <em>kashira</em> wig used in combination with this mask.
        </p>
        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/Doji1.png" %}

        <h4 id="Kokaji2">Second Act Mask: ‘Kotobide’</h4>

        <p>
          The mask used in the second half of the play may depend on the shite
          school and on the performance variant. The typical choice for the
          standard version of the play is Kotobide. The name of this mask means
          ‘small jump/pop-out’ and it describes its eyes, which appear as if
          they were popping out of the eye-sockets. ‘Small’ refers to the fact
          that there is a ‘large’ version of the mask (Ōtobide), used in other
          contexts. Kotobide is used for roles such as the deity of Mt. Inari in
          the form of a fox-god ‘(<em>Kokaji</em>) or the evil fox-spirit Tamamo
          no mae (<em>Sesshōseki</em>).
        </p>
        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/O-tobide1.png"
        %}
        <p>
          While the standard Kotobide has a reddish complexion, in the Kongō
          school performance analyzed in this website a variant type of the same
          mask, called Dei-kotobide (‘golden kotobide’) was used instead.
          Dei-kotobide is entirely covered with gold paint and features golden
          metal inserts for the eyes. According to noh conventions, gold
          symbolizes the supernatural nature of a character. The arched
          eyebrows, open wide round eyes, open mouth, and pointed mustache give
          the impression of an outburst of energy. Depending on the school and
          performance variant, the mask is used in combination with red or white
          kashira wig.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/O-tobide2.png"
        %}

        <p>
          The sculptural features of a mask differ from item to item. The one
          used in the performance filmed for this project is essentially the
          same as the standard Kotobide, except that its surface is painted gold
          instead of red. However, other Dei-kotobide are closer to the larger
          Ōtobide, which is used for the rain and thunder deity Wake-ikazuchi in
          <em>Kamo</em>, or for performance variants of <em>Kokaji</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mask used in the performance filmed is a Dei-kotobide carved by
          Iseki Bitchū no jō (Momoyama period)
        </p>

        <h4 id="Kokaji3">Ai-kyōgen Mask: ‘Noborihige’</h4>

        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/Kyogen-mask2.png" %}
        <p>
          Kyōgen masks tend to have exaggerated features and are often used to
          portray supernatural characters. Noborihige mask represents the face
          of a smiling rustic old man. Its name means ‘raising beard’, referring
          to its bristling-up sideburns. Other features are deep wrinkles, a
          toothless smile, and eyes carved in the shape of circumflex accents.
          <em>Noborihige</em> is mostly used in ai-kyōgen interludes for roles
          of <em>massha</em> (subsidiary deity) but may also be used for other
          kyōgen roles.
