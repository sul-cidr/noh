        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The Noh stage is unique in its shape and components. First of all, it
          has a single entrance and exit for the actors, designated by a
          multicolored curtain on the back-right side (directions are given in
          relation to an imaginary actor standing in center stage, facing the
          audience in front). The entrance opens up to a bridge sided with three
          pine trees that leads to the stage. This is the main space and is
          square in shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pine tree adorns the back wall and an extended space in the back and
          left side of the stage accommodate the musicians, while the jiutai’s
          members kneel in a space on the stage's left. The stage has four
          pillars and is covered by a roof that extends over the bridge. There
          is a small sliding door on the back-left corner of the stage that the
          stage attendants and jiutai members use to enter and leave the stage.
          Finally, the audience sits in a semi-circle from the right side to the
          front of the stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          The painted pine tree on the back wall of the stage reminds us of the
          outdoor origins of Noh. It is also a symbol of the famous Yōgō Pine at
          the Kasuga Shrine in Nara where Noh has been performed since its
          beginnings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The roof above the stage also testifies to the origins of Noh, which
          only moved indoors in 1882. Moreover, it references spaces of shinto
          rituals and the sacred architecture of shrines. It is supported by
          four named pillars. The right backstage pillar is referred to as the
          shite-pillar (<em>shite-bashira</em>) as it is the closest to the
          position he occcupies when engaged in an extensive conversation with
          the waki. The right front stage pillar is called the viewing-pillar
          (<em>metsuke-bashira</em>), and it is placed at the crossing point of
          all seating. These two pillars are particularly important in helping a
          masked actor whose sight is thus limited, to have a sense of space
          when walking or dancing. The left front stage pillar is called the
          waki-pillar (<em>waki-bashira</em>), since this is where the waki sits
          when he is not actively participating in the action. Finally, the left
          backstage pillar is referred to as the flute-pillar
          (<em>fue-bashira</em>), as this is where the nohkan player sits.
        </p>

        <p>
          The square-shaped stage is divided into a 3 x 3 grid, with nine named
          sub-squares. We have adopted the numbering method from 1 to 9 that
          Monica Bethe and Karen Brazell established, and used it when referring
          to specific sub-squares.
        </p>

        <p id="Squares"></p>

        {% include image.html src="/assets/images/Noh-Stage-2.png" %}

        <p>
          The sub-squares do not share the same dramatic potential since a dance
          movement is more powerful or subdued depending on where it is
          performed. Squares 3, 4, and 9 are the strongest positions, Square 3
          because it is in plain sight to all viewers, Square 4 because it is
          center-front stage, and Square 9 because it is center stage. Squares 1
          and 8 are used as starting and/or closing location for a dance or
          dance segment. Square 5 is usually occupied by the waki, who sits at
          that position once he has completed his entrance. Square 7 is rarely
          used being close to the nohkan player's kneeling position. Squares 2
          and 6 are often used as intermediate positions when a dancer is moving
          from back to front-stage or vice versa. There are also conventions
          associated with the stage. For instance, in the Kanze and Kongō
          schools, front-stage represents South, as shown in the Figure below.
          For the other three schools, front-stage represents North:

        <p>
          Another unique feature of the Noh stage is the upstage-right narrow
          bridge used by actors to access the stage proper. Although it is also
          used as a performing space, in the tradition of <em>mugen</em> Noh the
          bridge can be interpreted as a link between two separate realities,
          the everyday world and the otherworldly apparitions of ghosts and
          spirits. It functions as a liminal space between the waki's real world
          and the shite's other world. It is flanked by three pine trees used to
          divide the bridge into three parts. They are numbered from 1 to 3,
          where Pine 1 is closer to the stage, and Pine 3 closer to the curtain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under some Noh stages,large empty clay jars amplify the sound of the
          shite’s stamping, as well as the sound of the drums, flute, and voices
          from the jiutai.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Kokaji">Kokaji</h3>
        <p>
          The simplicity of the Noh stage allows for various reinterpretations
          of its space. For instance, the stage represents three different
          locations for the entrance of the three characters in Kokaji’s first
          act. The first one to appear is the wakizure, an imperial envoy. Thus,
          the bridge and stage represent the palace where he works. The second
          character to enter is the waki, Munechika the swordsmith, and at that
          moment, the bridge represents his house or factory. Finally, when the
          shite appears, the bridge, as well as the stage, represent somewhere
          outside of Munechika’s house. In Kokaji’s second act, the addition of
          a <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank">prop</a> helps
          identify a specific location, since the dais on Square 4 represents
          Munichika’s forge.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Hashitomi">Hashitomi</h3>
        <p>
          In Hashitomi, the first character to walk on stage is the waki, a monk
          living in Unrin-in Temple in northern Kyoto. Thus, the bridge and
          stage are understood to represent that temple. Things are little less
          obvious, though, with the entrance of the shite, a character who might
          be seen as a flower or as the ghost of a woman. As the monk is about
          to celebrate a mass for the flowers, he notices an unusual white one
          among his lot, and as he wonders about it, the shite, appearing as a
          woman, speaks for the flower. Some say that she is the flower’s voice,
          other say that she is physically present and embodied by the shite.
          The choreography adopted by the Kongō school appears to support the
          former interpretation. The distance between the two characters
          involved in a dialogue, the waki kneeling at Square 5 and the shite
          standing on the Bridge at the Second Pine, may suggest that the waki
          can hear but not see her. In Hashitomi’s second act, like in Kokaji’s,
          a <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank">prop</a> is
          brought in. It helps identify a specific location, since the prop
          standing on Square 8 represents the woman’s dwelling.
