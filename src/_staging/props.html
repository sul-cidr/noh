        <p>
          The bare nō stage with a permanent backdrop of a pine-painting and
          pines along the bridge way serves as the basic environment for all nō
          performances. The enacted scene lives in the imagination evoked by
          text, music, and movement. For some plays, however, imagery is made
          concrete through physical objects. The minimal structures suggestive
          of huts, tombs, carts, wells, trees, and bells, enhance the visual
          impact, focus the action, and serve as synecdoches interfacing with
          the poetic imagery. Handheld objects like pails, hammers, flowers, or
          swords add an element of reality.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Hashitomi">Hashitomi</h3>
        <p>
          The large property used in Hashitomi represents her delapidated
          <strong>dwelling</strong>. The rectangular cube has a thatched roof on
          top. It is constructed out of a square base made of bent bamboo with
          bamboo poles at the corners that are held in place with a bamboo frame
          at the top. Unique to Hashitomi is the half-size bamboo lattice
          shutter that can be raised and lowered using long poles attached to
          the bottom corners. A green vine with small dangling silver and gold
          gourds winds through the lattice on the shutter and along the
          structural poles. The vine represents the the yūgao ('evening face')
          plant and serves as a counterpoint to the flower imagery that runs
          through the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          While today shite actors assemble the large properties like the
          dwelling for Hashitomi before each performance, during the Edo period
          specialists known as 'property makers (<em>tsukurimono shi</em>) were
          connected to the acting troupes. The illustrated notes they kept
          specify the construction of the props. The Komparu-school notes shown
          below (<em>Okura ryū tsukurimono hiroku</em>; Okura Secret Notes on
          Properties) are particularly detailed.

        <p>
          In Hashitomi, the property is brought out after the kyōgen interlude
          and establishes the shift of scene from Unrin’in to Gojō. When it is
          carried onto the stage, it appears as a curtained thatch-roofed hut.
          The attendants carrying the prop must coordinate their movements with
          each other and also with the shite walking inside, invisible and
          imperceptible.
        </p>
        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/carrying-dwelling.png" %}
        <p>
          Yūgao’s dwelling can be placed in several areas – on the bridge, at
          right stage center (<em>waki sho</em>, square 2), or, as in this
          production and as is standard for most huts, in upstage center (<em
            >daishō mae</em
          >, square 8). The attendants center the prop, secure the curtain hem
          at the bottom and leave before the waki begins to sing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The waki, arriving at Gojō, finds the dwell 'as of old' with the
          evening-face gourds empty and the place overgrown with weeds. We do
          not see them yet, but the tiny silver gourds hanging from vines
          twisted about the skeletal framework of the dwelling create an ambiant
          glitter and are a distinguishing feature of the property.
        </p>

        <p>
          The waki facing diagonally back towards the dwelling focuses all the
          attention on it during the <em>issei</em> entrance music. The
          nochijite’s opening song eminates from behind the curtain. During the
          Ageuta 2, two stage attendants in coordinated motions release and then
          lower the curtain to reveal a bamboo framework with a half-length
          lattice shutter that half obscures the upper figure of Yūgao’s ghost.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/uncovering-dwelling.png" %}

        <p>
          The upward-lifting shutter is typical of Heian-period architecture
          (<em>shinden-zukuri</em>), and the screen-like effect of the lowered
          shutter recalls the court custom whereby ladies were separated off
          behind bamboo screens so their faces were hidden but the hems of their
          garments exposed.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html src="/assets/images/lattice.png" %}

        <p>
          On the promise that the monk will pray for her, Yūgao’s ghost steps
          out of the dwelling thus transforming the stage space into the
          memory-world of her encounter with Genji. The action of lifting the
          shutter with long sticks from behind and of her leaving the prop are
          described concurrently in words chanted by the chorus: “The
          vine-covered lattice shutter pushes open/revealing her form as she
          steps out.” Here oral narration is mimicked in movement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, in the middle of the kuse during the narration of Genji’s
          first encounter with Yūgao, the actions replicate the words. The shite
          performs the actions of Genji and his retainer Koremitsu in turn. As
          the chorus sings, “The flower was picked and presented” the shite goes
          to the property, takes hold of one of the dangling gourds towards the
          top, tugs at it, and then places it on the horizontally-held open fan
          so as to present it to Genji.
        </p>

        {% include image-no-background.html
        src="/assets/images/dwelling-in-back.png" %}

        <p>
          For the <em>jō-no-mai</em> instrumental dance that follows, the prop
          serves as a backdrop, somewhat reducing the performance space, but in
          the final scene, as the chorus narrates Yūgao’s actions of entering
          the dwelling and receding behind the lattice shutter. The shite steps
          into the prop, turns full circle within it, and sinks down to the
          words 'becoming one with the dream,' face obscured by the fan.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Kokaji">Kokaji</h3>
        <p>
          The property used in Kokaji is a platform representing the sword
          smithery. Brought out after the interlude before the second act, it is
          placed downstage center (<em>shōsaki</em>, square 4). The platform
          defines a space within a larger space, a room within a building, a
          stage within the stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          The single platform has a black and gold checkerboard cloth cover with
          red center and a sacred fencing around three sides. Corner posts stand
          at the front corners and along the two sides. Hanging folded paper
          streamers hang from a rope spanning post to post, indicating a Shinto
          method of demarkating sacred space. The corner posts may also hold
          large purification streamers (<em>hei</em>).
        </p>

        <p>
          Several hand props rest on the platform: (1) a Shintō purification rod
          <em>gohei</em>) with folded paper streamers, which the waki will use
          to purify the smithery in preparation for making the sword; (2) an
          anvil (<em>kanatoko</em>), (3) a hammer (<em>tsuchi</em>), and (4) the
          body of an unforged sword (<em>katanami</em>). The shite carries his
          own hammer.
        </p>

          To forge the new sword, the shite and waki mount the platform, take up
          their hammers, place the sword on the anvil and hammer while the
          chorus describes their actions.
