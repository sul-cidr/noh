    <h1>Noh as Intermedia</h1>
    <p>
      If one were to define 'intermedia' as a way of forming expression by
      drawing on relationships between arts, Noh Theater would be among its
      world’s most sophisticated and mighty exemplars. Zeami Motokiyo
      (c.1363-c.1443) who is credited with having perfected Noh as it still
      exists today, wrote in his <em>Fūshikaden</em> that in a successful play:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="blockquote__paragraph" markdown="1">
        … words should hold interest; the melody should be attractive; points of
        concentrated interest should be enacted with strong visual appeal. When
        all these elements come together at once, the entire audience is
        enchanted.[^1]
      </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the attempt to untangle some of the unique 'coming together' of
      artistic media in Noh, the website is divided into the following three
      sections:
