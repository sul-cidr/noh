    <h2>Six and Seven Stamps (<em>roku hyōshi nana byōshi</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      Stamp series usually starts with the left foot, then alternates right and
      left feet, gradually increasing the speed. Often, the first and last
      stamps are loud while those in the middle are softer. It is also customary
      for the meaning of the stamps to be connected to the text.

      This 6 + 7 stamp series involves a Small Right Circle (<em
        >migi komawari</em
      >). It is always performed in Martial mode.
