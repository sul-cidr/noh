    <h2>Grab hair</h2>

    <p>
      Circling the left arm up to his forehead, the dancer grabs the forelock of
      the headpiece and lifts it up, as if to see better. Similar to
      <a href="/movement/cloud-fan">Cloud fan (<em>uchiyage</em>)</a>, it
      suggests gazing into the distance. It can be performed either standing or
      kneeling, in which case its connotation of "attempting to better see far
      ahead‚Äù is highlighted by the dancer rising on his knee.
