    <h2>Grab hair</h2>

    <p>Circling the left arm up to his forehead, the dancer grabs the forelock of the headpiece and lifts it up, as if to see better. Similar to <a href="/movement/cloud-fan">Cloud fan (<em>uchiyage</em>)</a>, it suggests gazing into the distance. It can be performed either standing or kneeling, in which case its connotation of "attempting to better see far ahead” is highlighted by the dancer rising on his knee.
