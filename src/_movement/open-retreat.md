    <h2>Open-retreat (<em>hiraki</em>)</h2>

    <p>The Open-retreat pattern (<em>hiraki</em>) combines spreading the arms with three back steps. In this video it concludes with the Standing position (<em>kamae</em>).</p>

    <p>This is one of the most common patterns. It does not have a specific time or spatial points within a dance. Because of its ‘retreat’ motion (three back steps), it is usually preceded by a forward pattern such as the <a href="/movement/forward-point">Forward Point (<em>shikake</em>)</a>, <a href="/movement/scooping-point">Scooping Point (<em>kaikomi</em>)</a>, or a <a href="/movement/large-zigzag">Zigzag (<em>ōzayu</em>)</a>, among others. Originally, the pointing pattern was used to identify an object to contemplate, and the Open-retreat was a stepping back motion to better contemplate the identified object. In this video, it is preceded by the Forward Point pattern (<em>shikake</em>).</p>
