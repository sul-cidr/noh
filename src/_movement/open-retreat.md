    <h2>Open-retreat (<em>hiraki</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      The Open-retreat pattern (<em>hiraki</em>) combines spreading the arms
      with three back steps. In this video it concludes with the Standing
      position (<em>kamae</em>).

    <p>
      This is one of the most common patterns. It does not have a specific time
      or spatial points within a dance. Because of its ‘retreat’ motion (three
      back steps), it is usually preceded by a forward pattern such as the
      <a href="/movement/forward-point">Forward Point (<em>shikake</em>)</a>,
      <a href="/movement/scooping-point">Scooping Point (<em>kaikomi</em>)</a>,
      or a <a href="/movement/large-zigzag">Zigzag (<em>ōzayu</em>)</a>, among
      others. Originally, the pointing pattern was used to identify an object to
      contemplate, and the Open-retreat was a stepping back motion to better
      contemplate the identified object. In this video, it is preceded by the
      Forward Point pattern (<em>shikake</em>).
