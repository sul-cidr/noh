    <h2>Backing Point with Closed Fan (<em>sashi</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The
      different names come from the motion of the arm leading to the pointing
      conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the dancer takes two or three steps back, he circles his right arm out
      to the side, up in a high arc, and down in front of the body. This arm
      motion is called an overhand point. It can be performed with an Open (<em
        >mi wo kae</em
      >) or Closed fan (<em>sashi</em>). A comparison between the
      <a href="/movement/backing-point-open" target="_blank"
        >Backing point with Open fan (<em>mi wo kae</em>)</a
      >
      pattern illustrates how the open fan dramatically accentuates the arm
      motions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it can be performed in Feminine and Martial modes, it is
      performed here in Feminine mode.
