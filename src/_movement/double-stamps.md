    <h4><a href="/movement/">Catalog of Patterns:</a> Structural Patterns / Foot Motion: Stamps</h4>
    <h2>Double Stamps (<em>hidari migi hyōshi</em>)</h2>


    <p>Stamps can be performed singly, doubly or in sequence of 4 to 16.  While single and double stamps fall in the category of Structural patterns, sequences of stamps constitute a Mimetic pattern. Most dances start with a single or double stamp, and most Noh performances conclude with a double stamp.</p>

    <p>For martial roles, the foot stamp (<em>hyōshi</em>) is performed with the foot swiftly rising to knee level and sharply hitting the stage’s floor to create a loud boom. The stamping motion is separated by a step forward. Moreover, the stamping foot alternates, in the example the initial stamp is performed with the left foot, the next one with the right foot.
    Although, the Double foot stamp (<em>hidari migi hyōshi</em>) can be perform in feminine mode, it is shown here performed in marital mode only.</p>
