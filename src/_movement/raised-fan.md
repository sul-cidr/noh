    <h2>Raised Fan (<em>ageha</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      All Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The
      different names come from the arm performing the motion, leading to the
      pointing conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dancer brings the open fan in front of his face in a circular motion.
      From this position, he takes three steps back and simultaneously raises
      the fan over his head, then brings it to the side of the body also in a
      circular motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      While a dancer can perform this movement independently, it is usually
      performed by the shite as he sings a one- or two-line solo in the upper
      range, at the beginning of the third part of the <em>Kuse</em>. This solo
      is also called <em>ageha</em>.
