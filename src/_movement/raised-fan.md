    <h2>Raised Fan (<em>ageha</em>)</h2>

    <p>All Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The different names come from the arm performing the motion, leading to the pointing conclusion.</p>

    <p>The dancer brings the open fan in front of his face in a circular motion.  From this position, he takes three steps back and simultaneously raises the fan over his head, then brings it to the side of the body also in a circular motion.</p>

    <p>While a dancer can perform this movement independently, it is usually performed by the shite as he sings a one- or two-line solo in the upper range, at the beginning of the third part of the <em>Kuse</em>. This solo is also called <em>ageha</em>.</p>
