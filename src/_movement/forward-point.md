      and Arm Combinations: Pointing
    </h4>
    <h2>Forward Point (<em>shikake</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      All Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The
      different names come from the motion of the arm, leading to the pointing
      conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Forward point pattern (<em>shikake</em> ) combines forward steps,
      lifting the right arm and bringing the fan in line with the body’s central
      axis. This is one of the most common patterns. It does not have a specific
      time or spatial position within a dance. Depending on context, music and
      text, it can occur in the same dance— for one segment it can be used as an
      opening gesture, and for another segment can be used as a closing gesture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it can be performed by itself, it is very often followed by the
      <a href="/movement/open-retreat">Open-retreat(<em>hiraki</em>)</a>
      pattern, which combines three backing steps while the performer spreads
      his arms and then concludes in the Standing position (<em>kamae</em>).
      That sequence is shown here.
