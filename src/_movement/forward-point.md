    </h4>
    <h2>Forward Point (<em>shikake</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      All Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The
      different names come from the motion perform by the arm leading to the
      pointing conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Forward point pattern (<em>shikake</em> ) combines forward steps,
      lifting the right arm and bringing the fan in line with the bodyâ€™s central
      axis. This is one of the most common patterns. It does not have a specific
      time or spatial position within a dance. Hence depending on context, that
      is music and text, it can be found in the same dance used for one segment
      as an opening gesture, and as a closing gesture for another segment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it can be performed by itself it is very often followed by the
      <a href="/movement/open-retreat" target="_blank"
        >Open-retreat pattern (<em>hiraki</em>)</a
      >, which combines three backing steps while spreading the arms before
      concluding with the Standing position (<em>kamae</em>). It is that
      sequence that is shown here.
