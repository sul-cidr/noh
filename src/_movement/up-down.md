    <h4><a href="/movement/">Catalog of Patterns:</a> Mimetic Patterns / Body Patterns: Head</h4>
    <h2>Up and Down (<em>atama hidari to migi e hiza</em>)</h2>

    <p>While several mimetic patterns are clear, others are more subtle yet just as important. This is the case for head motion. It can occur anytime, but in certain sections, such as in the sitting kuse (called <em>iguse</em>), it is one of the very few motions, which increases its importance.</p>

<p>Head motion accentuates a line of text or brings focus to an important moment.  A sudden and angular head motion usually suggests surprise or a search for some object.</p>

<p>A pulled-in chin characterizes the basic position of the head and is important since most shites’ roles require a masked dancer. The pulled-in chin allows the mask to lay straight on the dancer’s face, the head motion changing the light on the mask, altering its expression.</p>


    <p>The head motions on this website are performed by a shite actor who would normally be masked, yet his clear facial expressions would lead one to believe otherwise.</p>

    <p>The Head patterns on this page are the folllowing:</p>
    <p>Head up (<em>atama ue e teru</em>): The side view clearly shows that the raising upper body motion facilitates the perception of this head motion.</p>
    <p>Head down (<em>atama shita e kumoru</em>): The side view clearly shows that the bending upper body motion facilitates the perception of this head motion.</p>
