    <h2>Six Stamps with Circling (<em>roku hyōshi</em>)</h2>

    <p>Stamp series usually starts with the left foot, then alternates right and left feet with gradually increasing speed.  Often, the first and last stamps are loud while those in the middle are softer. It is also customary for the meaning of the stamps to be connected to the text.</p>

<p>This Six-stamp series involves a Small Right Circle (<em>migi komawari</em>). It is always performed in Martial mode.</p>


    <p>The rhythm of the stamps in the context of the eight-beat unit is shown here. A black dot means a loud stamp, and a white one, a soft stamp:</p>
