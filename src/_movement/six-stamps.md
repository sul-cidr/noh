    <h2>Six Stamps (<em>norikomi roku hy≈çshi</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      Stamp series usually starts with the left foot, then alternate right, left
      feet gradually increasing the speed. Often, the first and last stamps are
      loud while those in the middle are softer. It is also customary for the
      meaning of the stamps to be related to the text.

      This 6 stamp series closes with a
      <a href="/movement/forward-point" target="_blank"
        >Forward Point (<em>shikake</em>)</a
      >. It is performed in Martial mode.
    </p>
