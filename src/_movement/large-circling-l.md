    <h2>Large Circling to the Left (<em>hidari ōmawari</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      Circling usually refers to moving in a large arc from upstage to
      downstage, helping define the dancing space. Because it is space-specific,
      it is helpful to know the following convention when it comes to numbering
      the areas on the <a href="/staging/stage">stage</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strongest stage positions are Squares 3 and 4 because they are the
      closest to the audience, and Square 9 because it is center stage. When
      performing a large left circle (<em>ōmawari</em>), the dancer moves from
      Squares 9 (or 4) to 6 and then 8. This overall motion from front to
      backstage, from a strong stage position to a weaker one, has the effect of
      releasing the tension.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two other circle patterns that cover a more limited amount of
      space: Medium circle (<em>chūmawari</em>) and the Small circle
      (<em>komawari</em>).
