    <h4><a href="/movement/">Catalog of Patterns:</a> Structural Patterns / Foot Motion: Circling</h4>
    <h2>Large Circling to the Left (<em>hidari ōmawari</em>)</h2>

    <p>Circling usually refers to moving in a large arc from upstage to downstage, helping define the dancing space. Because it is space-specific, it is helpful to know the following convention when it comes to numbering the areas on the <a href="/staging/stage">stage</a>.</p>

    <p>The strongest stage positions are Squares 3 and 4 because they are the closest to the audience, and Square 9 because it is center stage.  When performing a large left circle (<em>ōmawari</em>), the dancer moves from Squares 9 (or 4) to 6 and then 8. This overall motion from front to backstage, from a strong stage position to a weaker one, has the effect of releasing the tension.</p>

    <p>There are two other circle patterns that cover a more limited amount of space: Medium circle (<em>chūmawari</em>) and the Small circle (<em>komawari</em>).</p>
