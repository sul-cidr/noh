    <h2>Could Fan (<em>uchiyage</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      This is a variation on the
      <a href="/movement/open-retreat">Open-retreat pattern (<em>hiraki</em>)</a
      >. Performed with an opened fan, which is extended out to the right side,
      the arms come together in front of the body where the fan covers the left
      hand. As the dancer takes three steps back, he spreads his arms with the
      right one lifted high.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pattern is a dynamic way to look into the distance, often at
      something high in the sky like clouds or the moon.
