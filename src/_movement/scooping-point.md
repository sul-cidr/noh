    <h2>Scooping Point (<em>kaikomi</em>)</h2>

    <p>
      All Point patterns involve raising the right arm and pointing the fan. The
      different names come from the motion of the arm leading to the pointing
      conclusion.

    <p>
      The Scooping point (<em>kaikomi</em>) is a popular pattern. It can be used
      alone or in a sequence of patterns. The movement begins with a Right Step
      Pivot (<em>migi kakeru</em>), and a lifting of the extended left arm. As
      the dancer turns to face front stage, his extended right arm circles in an
      arc that comes down in front of the body before raising to shoulder level
      and pointing forward. This last motion of the arm is called an Extend
      point. (Sometimes when performed with a closed fan, the Extend point is
      replaced with an Overhand point.)
