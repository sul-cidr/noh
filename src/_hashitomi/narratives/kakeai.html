  <p>The <em>shōdan’s</em> expression remains simple but there is a subtle increase in the Intermedia Index. This is because there is an increase in the use of stage-space, a direct interaction between actors, and the mode of text delivery changes from <em>kotoba</em> to chanting.  </p>

  <p>The monk opens the <em>shōdan</em> by reciting the first line in <em>kotoba</em>. He is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha when he expresses surprise, noticing a smiling white flower. As he wonders about its provenance, he turns towards the apparition as if hoping for an answer. Her reply in singing mode creates an aura of mystery and beauty. Is she answering him or is he merely imagining this scene? While singing, the woman continues to slowly come closer to the monk without facing him. After arriving at Square 1, she faces the audience. Only later does she turn toward the monk and identifies the white flower as the ‘evening face’(<em>iugao</em> in Japanese). As if enchanted, the monk asks her in <time datetime='00:16:34.000' title='00:16:34'> singing mode </time> to identify herself. Facing front to engage both the audience and the monk, she replies in <time datetime='00:16:57.000' title='00:16:57'>spoken mode</time> that she is not ready to reveal her identity. The change back to speaking suggests her position on the topic is firm. But turning once again to face the monk she offers a clue, that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.</p>

  <p>There is a double entendre in the reply. In Murasaki Shikibu's novel <em>Genji monogatari</em>, Prince Genji, who was on his way to visit one of his mistresses, could not help but stop when he noticed beautiful white flowers on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring them, he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. It is as the ‘shadow’ of the white flower that Prince Genji met the lady who became known as Lady Yūgao, named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel. This is the same way Hashitomi’s main character is introduced to the monk.</p>
