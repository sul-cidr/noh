      While the monk is performing a service for the flowers, he notices a
      smiling white flower among his lot. In the ensuing dialogue he learns it
      is an ‘evening face’ (<em>iugao</em> in Japanese).

  <p>
    The <em>shōdan’s</em> expression remains simple but there is a subtle
    increase in the Intermedia Index. This is because there is an increase in
    the use of stage-space, a direct interaction between actors, and the mode of
    text delivery changes from <em>kotoba</em> to chanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    The monk opens the <em>shōdan</em> by reciting the first line in
    <em>kotoba</em>. He is in the process of dedicating flowers to Buddha when
    he expresses surprise, noticing a smiling white flower. As he wonders about
    its provenance, he turns towards the apparition as if hoping for an answer.
    Her reply in singing mode creates an aura of mystery and beauty. Is she
    answering him or is he merely imagining this scene? While singing, the woman
    continues to slowly come closer to the monk without facing him. After
    arriving at Square 1, she faces the audience. Only later does she turn
    toward the monk and identifies the white flower as the ‘evening face’(<em
      >iugao</em
    >
    in Japanese). As if enchanted, the monk asks her in
    <time datetime="00:16:34.000" title="00:16:34"> singing mode </time> to
    identify herself. Facing front to engage both the audience and the monk, she
    replies in
    <time datetime="00:16:57.000" title="00:16:57">spoken mode</time> that she
    is not ready to reveal her identity. The change back to speaking suggests
    her position on the topic is firm. But turning once again to face the monk
    she offers a clue, that she comes from the white flower’s shadow.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a double entendre in the reply. In Murasaki Shikibu's novel
    <em>Genji monogatari</em>, Prince Genji, who was on his way to visit one of
    his mistresses, could not help but stop when he noticed beautiful white
    flowers on a fence in front of a dilapidated house. As he was admiring them,
    he noticed a beautiful woman in the house. It is as the ‘shadow’ of the
    white flower that Prince Genji met the lady who became known as Lady Yūgao,
    named after the flower. Her real name is never mentioned in the novel. This
    is the same way Hashitomi’s main character is introduced to the monk.
