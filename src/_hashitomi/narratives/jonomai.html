        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The jiutai, speaking for Yūgao spirit, begins the recitation of a poem Prince Genji sent to her, recalling memories of the time they were together. As an instrumental dance, the <em>Jonomai</em> does not engage with the story. However, it represents an expressive climax colored by the narrative that precedes it. The actor and the audience can project into the dance, character traits and identities of the iugao flower, Lady Yūgao, and the emotions of the romantic affair with Genji.</div>

  <p>At the end of the <em>Kuse</em>, the jiutai singing for the spirit of Lady Yūgao starts to recite the very first poem that Prince Genji wrote to her, but as if taken by emotions, as if poetic words could not fully express her deepest feelings anymore, she interrupts the recitation, and begins to dance. </p>

  <p>The elegant <em>Jonomai</em> dance closely interweaves choreography with music. It is composed of five sections, which can be accessed by clicking on their names below:</p>

  <p>The form of the <em>Jonomai</em> is cyclical because it is primarily articulated through the nohkan’s <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai" target="_blank">repeated patterns</a>. They are identified in the score below the video with the following legend: Chū – C, Kan – K, Kan no Chū – KC, Ryo – R, Oroshi – Or and Dan – D.  </p>

  <p>While a dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> is structured around salient mimetic <em>kata</em>, an instrumental dance is not. Instead, particular structural <em>kata</em> paired with vocal calls of the percussion play a specific formal function. For instance, <em>kata</em> involving the fan, often accompanied by sleeve motion, are used to anticipate the beginning of a section. Having performed the <em>Jo</em> and <em>Kakari</em>  with a closed fan, the shite announces the imminent beginning of the <em>First dan</em> by  <time datetime='01:08:13.000' title='01:08:13'>Opening of the Fan</time>. After having brought it in front of his face for a Raised fan <em>kata</em>, the dancer brings it down to  waist-level, where it is commonly held. Then, a <time datetime='01:11:56.000' title='01:11:56'> Fan Reverse Hold and a Right Sleeve Flipped </time> signals the upcoming beginning of the <em>Second dan</em>. Lastly, a <time datetime='01:15:25.000' title='01:15:25'>Left Sleeve Flipped</time> announces the coming of the <em>Third dan</em>. While these <em>kata</em> anticipate an upcoming <em>dan</em>, the actual beginning of each <em>dan</em> is in fact marked by the extended <em> kakegoe 'iya'</em>, which within the congruent sections are reserved exclusively for this purpose. Finally, the shite signals the dance's closing phase by <time datetime='01:15:51.000' title='01:15:51'> Resetting the Sleeves</time> and Renesting of the Fan to standard hold. </p>

  <p>While arm motions involving the fan and sleeves and specific <em>kakegoe</em> announce the beginning of a section, foot motion paired with a percussion pattern articulate the sections' closing. This is done by stamping, followed by the ōtsuzumi’s six consecutive strokes <em>shikake</em> pattern. For example, the shite concluded the <em>kakari</em> by performing a <time datetime='01:07:45.000' title='01:07:45'> Left Stamp and Right Stamp</time> followed by <em>shikake</em>. The closing of the <time datetime='01:11:33.000' title='01:11:33'> First </time> and <time datetime='01:15:08.000' title='01:15:08'> Second </time> <em>dan</em> introduce variations on the stamping and a <em>shikake</em> sequence.</p>

 <p>The very end of the <em>Jonomai</em> is also signaled with a <em>kata</em> and tempo change. The shite concludes the dance by performing a <a href="/movement/raised-fan/" target="_blank">Raised Fan</a> <em>kata</em>. Commonly performed as he sings the <em>ageha</em> solo line in the <em>Kuse</em>, it can however appear anytime. By performing the Raised Fan <em>kata</em> at the conclusion of the dance, the shite who has been silent throughout the <em>Jonomai</em>, is setting up an expectation for chant. The transition is further underlined by a sudden change of tempo. Controlled by the percussionists, the tempo gradually and steadily accelerates throughout the Third <em>dan</em> to reach the dance’s fastest speed at its penultimate <em>honji</em>. Then, it slows down in preparation for the nohkan’s conclusive and slow <em>tome</em> pattern, which in Hashitomi’s case, <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'>overlaps</time> with the beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Waka</em>. </p>

  <p>The differences in the use of stage-space also help articulate the dance’s five-section structure. The <em>Jo</em> takes place exclusively on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 1</a>. The <em>kakari</em> and the Third <em>dan</em> see the shite dancing across the whole stage, whereas stage-space use in the First and Second <em>dan</em> is rather limited.</p>

  <p>The use of the stage-space in the <em>kakari</em> is also noteworthy. The nohkan player introduces its core sequence of patterns called <em>Ji</em>, which he repeats four times, while the shite opens the stage-space. Holding a closed fan in his right hand, the shite first traverses the right lateral over the first <em>Ji</em> —Squares 1 to 3— then the front stage over the second one— Squares 3 to 5— and finally the left-right transversal over the last two <em>Ji</em> —Squares 5 to 1. This trajectory does not only open the stage-space, it also creates a spatial wave of tension-release. Backstage positions such as Square 1 and 8, further from the audience, are essentially positions of released tension. They are often used as starting and closing positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other hand, frontstage positions such as Square 3 and 4 and center-stage Square 9, closer to the audience, are positions of strength. Therefore, the motion from Square 1 to 3 is building momentum, bringing the shite from a position of released tension in Square 1 to the front in Square 3. The motion from Square 3 to 5 maintains momentum since the dancer remains in the stage’s forefront. Finally, the motion from Square 5 to 1 releases tension, taking the shite from frontstage to backstage.</p>

  <p>The <em>kakari’s</em> choreography exemplifies the overall modularity of Noh. The same stage-space use can be seen in both instrumental dances featured on this website: the <em>kakari</em> of this slow and elegant <em>Jonomai</em>, and the first section of the dynamic and virile <a href="/kokaji/maibataraki/" target="_blank"><em>Maibataraki</em></a> dance in Kokaji.</p>

  <p>Another intermedia pointer in the <em>Jonomai</em> is the <em>oroshi</em> pattern. It is recognizable aurally as it is a two-<em>honji</em>-long <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/jonomai#Oroshi" target="_blank">slow-down</a>, during which the shite moves to a quieter stage position and stops. For instance, in the First <em>dan’s oroshi</em>, he takes <time datetime='01:09:07.000' title='01:09:07'> Four Steps Back</time> to move from the dynamic Square 3 to the weaker Square 2. In the Second <em> dan’s oroshi </em>, the shite performs a <time datetime='01:12:48.000' title='01:12:48'> release-tension</time> move by taking Seven Steps Back from the strong Square 9 to the quieter Square 6. </p>
