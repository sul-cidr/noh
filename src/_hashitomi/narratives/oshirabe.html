          <p><em>Oshirabe</em> exemplifies the expressive use of intermedia at its minimum. The spectacle, which will eventually involve a richness of elements, begins with only music sounding from behind the curtain. The instruments are introduced sequentially, starting with the nohkan, followed by the kotsuzumi, and finally the ōtsuzumi who completes the <em>hayashi</em>. There is no singing, and the percussionists do not utter any <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Kakegoe " target="_blank"><em>kakegoe</em></a>. After a minute or two, the <em>Oshirabe</em> is concluded as the musicians drop out, one after the other in reverse order. Music performed invisibly is at its most fleeting. The audience is offered a mere ‘ghost’ of it. The absence of other elements intensifies the anticipation. As the viewers fall into silence, they get to appreciate the visual aspects of the stage in the atmosphere evoked by the music. This minimalistic beginning is a perfect starting point for a gradual intermedia development that is the essence of a Noh play. </p>
