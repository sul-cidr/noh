      The <em>Kuse</em> is the first <em>shōdan</em> in the play that
      extensively uses dance-to-text movement. The gradual expanded use of the
      stage-space follows the overall three-part subdivision of the
      <em>shōdan</em>. In Part I the performance of most <em>kata</em> happens
      on <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 9</a>. The use
      of stage-space is extended to Squares 2 and 3 in Part II, and also
      includes Squares 4, 8, and 9 in Part III.

    In the general Noh repertoire the <em>Kuse</em>, together with the
    <em>Kiri</em>, are <em>shōdan</em> featuring dance-to-text. This does not
    apply, however, to the <em>Kuse</em> in typical third category plays, which
    follow a purely structural abstract choreography. Hashitomi is exceptional
    in that it follows the general tradition of using mimetic movements in this
    <em>shōdan</em>. The <em>Kuse</em> and <em>Kiri</em> are often highlights of
    intermedia relationships as they involve dance, dramatic use of stage-space,
    and text correlated with mimetic movements.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text divides the narrative into three parts, each one marked by gradual
    increase in the use of stage-space. The
    <time datetime="00:51:58.000" title="00:51:58">first part</time> introduces
    Genji and his romance with Lady Yūgao, as she recalls the prayer they heard
    on their first night. The use of stage-space limited to the center-stage (<a
      href="/staging/stage/#Squares"
      target="_blank"
      >Square 9</a
    >) underlines the introductory quality of the narrative. The tone of the
    <time datetime="00:55:46.000" title="00:55:46">second part</time>
    intensifies slightly as the spirit of Lady Yūgao remembers that her
    introduction to Genji was initiated by his interest in a flower. The
    stage-space reflects the growing intensity by adding movement on
    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 2 and 3</a>. We
    learn in the
    <time datetime="00:57:45.000" title="00:57:45"> third part</time>, that it
    is while contemplating a flower at Lady Yūgao’s gate that Genji noticed her
    in the distance, and that their romantic encounter started with a picked
    flower presented on a fan. The pivotal nature of the moment is paralleled by
    the use of almost the entire stage-space.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the spirit of Lady Yūgao (sung by jiutai) recounts that during her
    first night with Genji the lovers heard from next door a pilgrim’s voice in
    prayer, the shite performs a slow sequence of
    <time datetime="00:53:09.000" title="00:53:09"
      >steps that lead to the subtle Mind Listening <em>kata</em></time
    >, done by slightly bending his upper body forward. As the jiutai is about
    to recite the heard <em>sutra</em>, the kotsuzumi plays a
    <em><time datetime="00:53:34.000" title="00:53:34">hajiki</time></em>
    pattern, which includes an off-beat attack that immediately follows the
    ōtsuzumi’s stroke on the first beat. This rare pattern, with its
    oddly-positioned attack, creates a syncopated effect that suggests a sort of
    "quotation mark" before the prayer begins.
    <time datetime="00:53:39.000" title="00:53:39"> The <em>sutra</em></time>
    includes twenty-one syllables, set in a sequence of four uneven measures (4,
    6, 4 and 8 beats long). This allows for a spacious distribution of syllables
    and slow pacing appropriate for a prayer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moved by the monk's service for the flowers, Lady Yūgao shows him a
    <time datetime="00:54:30.000" title="00:54:30">profound appreciation</time>
    by taking Five Steps in his direction, then One Step Back, before performing
    the <a href="/movement/kneeling-p/" target="_blank">Kneeling in Prayer</a>.
    The poignancy of the moment is heightened by the entrance of the nohkan's
    <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >
    pattern. Then, as the jiutai sings, “<em
      >… unwittingly tears dampen my sleeves</em
    >” the shite performs
    <a href="/movement/l-hand/" target="_blank">Left-Hand Weeping</a>
    <em>kata</em>. This touching moment ends with the two percussion instruments
    playing the standard closing
    <em><time datetime="00:55:29.000" title="00:55:29">uchikiri</time></em>
    pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mimesis can take a different form when the text gives meaning to abstract
    structural <em>kata</em>. For a short time span, text and
    <em>kata</em> associate the shite with four different characters. First,
    when the jiutai sings,
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:55:59.000" title="00:55:59"
        >“When Genji first saw this house”</time
      ></em
    >, the shite performs a standard Forward pointing <em>kata</em>, but because
    it is directed towards the <em>tsukurimono</em> it implies that the shite is
    Prince Genji's pointing to Lady Yūgao's house. A moment later, we hear
    <time datetime="00:56:54.000" title="00:56:54"
      >Genji beckons his personal attendant Koremitsu</time
    >
    to pick a flower for him that grows by the house. The shite, now personifies
    Koremitsu, who carries out the order. This appears as a mimetic
    <em>kata</em> sequence: Left hand picks up of the flower, Laying of the
    flower on the fan, Kneeling and the Two hands offering of the fan. The
    moment of offering the flower on the fan has a dramatic emphasis because the
    music significantly slows down, and leads to the <em>ageha</em>, the sole,
    short vocal entrance of the shite during the whole <em>Kuse</em>. Referring
    to the flower on the fan, the shite sings “<em
      >Genji, gazing at it intently</em
    >”, as he earnestly looks at his own fan. At this moment, the shite
    personifies Genji. Finally, as the jiutai sings words attributable to Genji
    “<em>Of you passing in the distance...</em>” the shite performs a
    <a href="/movement/large-zigzag/" target="_blank">Large Zigzag</a>
    interpretable as the moment he first laid eye on Lady Yūgao as she walked in
    the distance. The coinciding entrance of the nohkan’s
    <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari" target="_blank"
      ><em>takane mi kusari</em></a
    >
    pattern adds intensity to this most important moment, as Lady Yūgao appears
    in the shadow of the flower.
