    The <em>Rongi</em> involves two vocal parts: the shite and jiutai. While the
    <a href="/hashitomi/issei/" target="_blank"><em>Issei</em>-chant</a>
    provides a compelling example of a single line split between three vocal
    parts, the <em>Rongi</em> presents an interesting example of one part—the
    jiutai—lending its voice to two different characters. It speaks for the
    monk, the spirit, and as a narrator.
  </p>

  <p>
    For instance, the jiutai speaks for the monk when it asks the main character
    to <time datetime="00:47:39.000" title="00:47:39">reveal her form</time>.
    Facing front, as if for everyone to hear, the spirit of the woman, rather
    than complying, provides a clue to her identity by reciting
    <time datetime="00:48:07.000" title="00:48:07"> a poem </time> that Lady
    Yūgao wrote to Genji, a reference to the <em>Genji monogatari</em>. As she
    concludes, she turns to the monk and asks, “When will they ever meet again?”
  </p>

  <p>
    As she turns right to face the front, the jiutai speaks for her, beginning
    to sing
    <time datetime="00:49:03.000" title="00:49:03"> another poem </time> also
    authored by Lady Yūgao.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, once again the jiutai speaks for the woman’s spirit when it asks the
    monk,
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:49:38.000" title="00:49:38">
        “If I reveal the form …”
      </time></em
    >. At this point, she once again turns left to face the monk, and asks,
    “...will you pray for my soul?” The jiutai, now speaking for the monk,
    affirms that he will.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon hearing this confirmation, she turns right to face the audience and
    mentions her name:
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:50:06.000" title="00:50:06">
        “… ‘ the evening face’”</time
      ></em
    >. The jiutai becomes a narrator and describes the spirit of Lady Yūgao
    coming out of the
    <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>hashitomi</em></a
    >. As she steps out and reveals her full figure, the monk honors his promise
    and prays for her.
  </p>

  <p>
    The question about the main character’s identity is at the heart of many Noh
    plays. It is not, however, their purpose. Instead, it is a pretext for the
    plot, usually centered around the circumstances of the encounter between a
    spirit and a commoner. In an unfolding story, the main character usually
    dances only when his or her identity has been revealed. It is in that regard
    that the identity of the shite’s character matters. In Hashitomi’s context,
    the veil around main character’s identity is lifted in the <em>Rongi</em>,
    just before the dance-to-text <em>Kuse</em> and instrumental dance
    <em>Jonomai</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The percussion duo and the nohkan are both used at key moments related to
    the revealing of the main character’s identity. The two percussion
    instruments accompany the dialogue with sparse
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji</em></a
    >
    patterns, except for two lines, both related to the shite's visual identity.
    For these two lines, the percussionists switch to steady
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Tsuzuke" target="_blank"
      ><em>tsuzuke</em></a
    >
    patterns, producing a change in the texture that highlights the text. The
    first case refers to the moment when the monk asks the spirit to
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:47:49.000" title="00:47:49"
        >”reveal her form,”</time
      ></em
    >
    while the second case comes when the jiutai, speaking for the spirit, asks
    the monk,
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:49:38.000" title="00:49:38">
        “If I reveal the form…”</time
      ></em
    >, “<em>… will you pray for my soul ?</em>”
  </p>

  <p>
    The nohkan plays only once in the <em>shōdan</em>, performing the
    <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"
      ><em>mi roku no ge</em></a
    >
    pattern as the jiutai describes the spirit of Lady Yūgao stepping out of the
    <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>hashitomi</em></a>
    and finally revealing her form. Besides bringing the corresponding text to
    prominence and giving it emotional depth:
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:51:14.000" title="00:51:14"
        >“At the sight tears flow without stopping.”</time
      ></em
    >, the nohkan's part also overlaps with the
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >, that functions as a smooth transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the
    <em>Kuse</em>.
