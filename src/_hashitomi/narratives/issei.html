      The entrance <em>Issei</em>-music occupies the <em>Issei’s</em> first
      three of twelve <em>honji</em>. During the first one the rhythmic setting
      of percussion switches from
      <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank"
        >flexible</a
      >
      to strict. The process is perceived through the changing
      <em>kakegoe</em> when the first two extended calls of the ōtsuzumi player,
      which are reminiscent of the flexible setting, are answered by the
      kotsuzumi playerwith shorter calls, typical of the strict setting. This
      switch leads to the non-congruent nohkan’s

      pattern, which in turn leads to the

    The <em>Issei</em>-chant, introduces a counterpoint of two intertwined poems
    that are recited by two actors passing lines back and forth. The process
    starts in the preceding <em>Kakaru</em>, where the waki sings the first two
    lines of the
    <time datetime="00:39:23.000" title="00:39:23">first poem</time>. Then, the
    shite opens the <em>Issei</em>-chant by singing the poem’s
    <time datetime="00:42:15.000" title="00:42:15">third line</time>, but rather
    than finishing it, he introduces the first two lines of a
    <time datetime="00:42:48.000" title="00:42:48">second poem</time>. It is the
    jiutai who
    <time datetime="00:43:35.000" title="00:43:35">completes</time> the second
    poem with its last line, before singing the
    <time datetime="00:43:57.000" title="00:43:57"> last two lines</time> of the
    first. The process is summarized in this figure:

  <p>
    Sharing a poetic line (composed from two poems) between three different
    'actors' signals an important moment in the overall structure. It turns away
    from fact-based story-telling to more abstract aesthetics of poetry, music
    and eventually, dance.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is noteworthy that although the waki’s participation in the singing is
    over at this point in the play, he is still an active player. For instance,
    the moment the shite starts chanting from inside the
    <em>tsukurimono</em> the waki
    <time datetime="00:42:26.000" title="00:42:26">slides on his knee</time> to
    face it. By showing that he can hear the voice he adds to its materiality
    even though it is produced by an invisible source. Alternatively, it could
    indicate that everything continues to happen in the mind of the monk.
