        <div class="section-introduction__definition">The entrance <em>Issei</em>-music occupies the <em>Issei’s</em> first three of twelve <em>honji</em>. During the first one the rhythmic setting of percussion switches from <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#strictness" target="_blank">flexible</a> to strict. The process is perceived through the changing <em>kakegoe</em> when the first two extended calls of the ōtsuzumi player, which are reminiscent of the flexible setting, are answered by the kotsuzumi playerwith shorter calls, typical of the strict setting. This switch leads to the non-congruent nohkan’s <em><time datetime='00:41:25.000' title='00:41:25'> mi roku no ge</time></em> pattern, which in turn leads to the <time datetime='00:42:08.000' title='00:42:08'>chanted</time> exchange between the shite and the jiutai. The <a href="/music/voices#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant is delivered in <a href="/music/voices#Yowagin" target="_blank"><em>yowagin</em></a> style.

<p>The <em>Issei</em>-chant, introduces a counterpoint of two intertwined poems that are recited by two actors passing lines back and forth. The process starts in the preceding <em>Kakaru</em>, where the waki sings the first two lines of the <time datetime='00:39:23.000' title='00:39:23'>first poem</time>. Then, the shite opens the <em>Issei</em>-chant by singing the poem’s <time datetime='00:42:15.000' title='00:42:15'>third line</time>, but rather than finishing it, he introduces the first two lines of a <time datetime='00:42:48.000' title='00:42:48'>second poem</time>. It is the jiutai who <time datetime='00:43:35.000' title='00:43:35'>completes</time> the second poem with its last line, before singing the <time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'> last two lines</time> of the first. The process is summarized in this figure:</p>

<p>Sharing a poetic line (composed from two poems) between three different 'actors' signals an important moment in the overall structure. It turns away from fact-based story-telling to more abstract aesthetics of poetry, music and eventually, dance. </p>

<p>It is noteworthy that although the waki’s participation in the singing is over at this point in the play, he is still an active player. For instance, the moment the shite starts chanting from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em> the waki <time datetime='00:42:26.000' title='00:42:26'>slides on his knee</time> to face it. By showing that he can hear the voice he adds to its materiality even though it is produced by an invisible source. Alternatively, it could indicate that everything continues to happen in the mind of the monk.</p>
