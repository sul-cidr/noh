  <p>The end of the preceding 'Waki enters' <em>dan</em> has set the scene for the arrival of the main actor. The chanting has ceased and the waki has left center-stage for his post on Square 5. The shite’s entrance music starts with the percussion instruments in flexible mode, performing a slow music composed of sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns. It is at the second <em>honji</em> that the nohkan joins them with a variation of the non-congruent <a href="/music/nohkan/rokunoge" target="_blank"><em>roku no ge</em></a> pattern. The haunting, very slow and free-flowing melody with limited ornamentation, sets a humble yet refined tone evocative of enigmatic beauty. As if "summoned" by the music, the main character appears slowly, seemingly out of nowhere. The absence of periodic pulsations creates an unsettling feeling, which matches the spirit of a dream or otherworldly appearance.</p>

  <p>The timing, gesture and expression of the curtain lifting depends on the shite's cue. After waiting for the right moment, the way the shite utters <em>omaku</em> suggests to the stage assistant the manner in which the lifting is to be executed. In the featured performance, the shite waited until the third <em>honji</em>, providing the music with ample time to set the proper mood.</p>

  <p>As the shite enters the bridge, the curtain goes down as slowly as it was lifted. The actor walks very slowly, taking two minutes to reach the First Pine. His appearance is gradual. At first, the mask can solely be seen from the profile. Only as the shite is about to sing and the entrance music comes to an end, <time datetime='00:12:23.000' title='00:12:23'>does he turn </time> toward the audience, thus revealing the mask in full-face. Not having entered the stage proper may imply that the apparition still remains invisible to the monk.</p>
