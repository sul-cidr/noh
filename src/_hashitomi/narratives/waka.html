  <p>TThe very short <em>Waka</em> is both a contrast and a bridge between the two major <em>shōdan</em>:  the <em>Jonomai</em> and the <em>Kiri</em>. It releases tension built by the intense aestheticism of the instrumental dance and prepares for a narrative ending.</p>

    <p>After the instrumental dance <em>Jonomai</em>, rich in use of various movements and extensive stage-space, the intermedia richness temporarily drops with the <em>Waka</em>, as the shite performs a single <em>kata</em>, a held Raised Fan. He does so standing in center stage, which allows him to retain energy and exert command of the stage. The music, which maintains the dynamic percussion strict rhythmic setting, brings back chanting. The <time datetime='01:17:40.000' title='01:17:40'>melisma </time> of shite's non-congruent <a href="/music/voices/#Einori" target="_blank"><em>einori</em></a> chant extends the dance's aesthetic focus and recalls the highly ornamented slow nohkan melody.</p>

  <p>The percussion part forms another bridge between two rhythmically congruent but divergent <em>shōdan</em>. The slow speed of the preceding <em>Jonomai</em> gave it a free-flowing temporal feeling that was well-suited for the dance of an elegant young lady. It is in clear contrast with the steady-beat of the <em>ōnori</em> chant of the coming <em>Kiri</em>. In the <em>Waka</em>, the drums start with two <em>honji</em> of broad and sparse <time datetime='01:17:26.000' title='01:17:26'><em>mitsuji</em> patterns</time> then, accelerate toward the  <time datetime='01:17:52.000' title='01:17:52'>last two</time> <em>honji</em> of <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns. At the same time the initial extended <em>kakegoe</em> of the ōtsuzumi player that seemed to imply a flexible setting are answered by short <em>kakegoe</em> of the kotsuzumi player. By the time they play <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns they are both in strict rhythm, setting up the beat for the <em>Kiri's</em> <em>ōnori</em> chant.</p>
