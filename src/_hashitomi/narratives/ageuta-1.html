  <p>The first <em>Ageuta</em> is the dramatic and intermedia climax not only of the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>, but of the whole first act. It brings a new and refreshing sound: the jiutai, the last performer who had not yet taken part in the play. The jiutai’s first entrance always delineates an important moment in a play, hence it's special name: <em>shodō</em>. The <em>Ageuta</em> is also the first <em>shōdan</em> accompanied by the full <em>hayashi</em> – the two percussion instruments and the nohkan. It produces the richest and most rhythmically consolidated texture so far with the chant set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the percussion in strict rhythmic setting.</p>

  <p>The narrative introduces an important piece of information about the main character's identity. In the very first line, it gives the location of her dwelling in Gōjo. According to the <em>Genji monogatari</em>, this location is associated with Lady Yūgao’s home. It is standard for an <em>Ageuta’s</em> first line to be repeated, a repetition that underlines the text.  Moreover, it is also standard to separate the initial statement and its repetition with an <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"><em>uchikiri</em></a> that temporarily interrupts the narrative, creating a <em>ma</em> moment that emphasizes the repeated line: “<em><time datetime='00:19:27.000' title='00:19:27'>Near Gojō, she said, of the ‘evening face.’</time></em>”.</p>

  <p>The final passage involves stage movement related to the text. While the jiutai sings, <em><time datetime='00:19:41.000' title='00:19:41'>“In the moment the eyes turn aside, she becomes a dream,”</time></em> the shite takes Six Steps Forward, in preparation for a <time datetime='00:20:10.000' title='00:20:10'>Right Circlet</time>, performed to mimic the woman’s disappearance, as announced by the jiutai: “<em>…as she disappears in the shadow of the flowers.</em>.” As the melodic line, supported by the nohkan’s <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a> pattern, moves from the high range to medium, preparing to cadence in the low range, the shite performs the standard closing pair of movements <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>. Then, the shite slowly leaves the stage in complete silence.</p>
