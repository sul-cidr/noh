      <p>The <em>Ai-kyōgen</em> interlude in Hashitomi has a typically simple intermedia character. The kyōgen actor converses with the waki with very little movement and mostly without music.</p>

       <p>In preparation for the <em>Ai-kyōgen</em>, the percussionists fold their chairs, as all musicians <time datetime='00:22:45.000' title='00:22:45'>  kneel in a straight line facing sideways </time> to indicate that although they are on stage they are not involved.</p>

      <p>However, half way through the interlude, when the kyōgen turns back to speak with the waki, the drummers return to sitting on the chairs. It is the tradition of the Morita school of nohkan playing to layer the final section of the <em>Ai-kyōgen</em>, with a melodic pattern called <em>shimo no takane</em>. It is a non-congruent melody that includes few original patterns but also others akin to <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"><em>mi roku no ge</em></a>, <a href="/music/nohkan/takane-hane" target="_blank"><em>takane hane</em></a>, and <em>kuse-no-ryo</em>. The end of the <em>shimo no takane</em> coincides more of less with the end of the dialogue between the kyōgen and the waki. Having memorized the text, the nohkan player positions his patterns accordingly. The melody also serves as a signal to the actors in the backstage that the second act is about to begin.
