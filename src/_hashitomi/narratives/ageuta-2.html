  <p>
    In the preceding two <em>shōdan</em>, the audience only hears a voice from
    the <em>tsukurimono</em>. Now, when the drape around the
    <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a>
    is removed the spirit finally shows itself. The revealing is gradual. The
    lowering of the drape is slow and the actor still remains partly concealed
    by a lattice gate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The expression of the moment is colored by the melancholy of the text, sung
    by the jiutai, which speaks of a limpid moon casting its light on a zither
    stand. The words that follow refer to
    <time datetime="00:46:47.000" title="00:46:47">the autumn evening</time>. It
    is a metaphor for the 'beginning of the end' and a variation on the theme of
    sadness already introduced in the previous two <em>shōdan</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This coincides with the first mimetic movement of the second act. In a
    context of minimal motion, small gestures gain importance. As the jiutai
    sings “<em>beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains</em>”, the shite, who is
    still sitting in the <em>tsukurimono</em>, slides to the right as if to
    better admire them. The feeling of sorrow lingers through the
    <time datetime="00:47:02.000" title="00:47:02"> last line </time>:
    <em>such a desolate evening!</em>.
