  <p>In the preceding two <em>shōdan</em>, the audience only hears a voice from the <em>tsukurimono</em>. Now, when the drape around the <a href="/staging/props/#Hashitomi" target="_blank"><em>tsukurimono</em></a> is removed the spirit finally shows itself. The revealing is gradual. The lowering of the drape is slow and the actor still remains partly concealed by a lattice gate.</p>

  <p>The expression of the moment is colored by the melancholy of the text, sung by the jiutai, which speaks of a limpid moon casting its light on a zither stand. The words that follow refer to <time datetime='00:46:47.000' title='00:46:47'>the autumn evening</time>. It is a metaphor for the 'beginning of the end' and a variation on the theme of sadness already introduced in the previous two <em>shōdan</em>.  </p>

  <p>This coincides with the first mimetic movement of the second act. In a context of minimal motion, small gestures gain importance. As the jiutai sings “<em>beyond the hedge, the autumn mountains</em>”, the shite, who is still sitting in the <em>tsukurimono</em>, slides to the right as if to better admire them. The feeling of sorrow lingers through the <time datetime='00:47:02.000' title='00:47:02'> last line </time>: <em>such a desolate evening!</em>. </p>
