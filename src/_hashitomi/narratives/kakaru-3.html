  <p>A <em>tsukurimono</em> stands on Square 8, representing what used to be Lady Yūgao’s dwelling. The waki sings, standing on Square 5, facing it.  This <em>Kakaru</em> is spread over five eight-beat measures (<em>honji</em>). It starts simply with the waki singing a non-congruent <em>sashinori</em> chant accompanied by the drums in flexible rhythmic setting. Half-way in the third <em>honji</em>, the kotsuzumi player initiates a <time datetime='00:39:55.000' title='00:39:55'> switch </time> from flexible to strict setting, a motion recognizable by his much shorter <em>kakegoe</em>. At this point, the percussionists also switch from the sparse <em>mitsuji</em> to the steadier <em>tsuzuke</em>patterns. This change coincides with a <time datetime='00:40:08.000' title='00:40:08'>switch in the text from prose to verse </time>, as the waki starts reciting a <a href="/text-hashitomi/#Waki-waits"  target="_blank"> poem</a>. It refers to a Confucian disciple and to ‘empty gourds,’ a metaphor for poverty. This foreshadows the theme of sadness that will weave through the next three <em>shōdan</em>. </p>
