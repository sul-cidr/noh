  <p> With its text set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied percussion instruments in strict rhythm, the <em>Sageuta</em> is the first of a sequence of five consecutive congruent <em>shōdan</em>. The text of the second act has now shifted from prose to verse.</p>

  <p>A nostalgic tone is introduced. It started with the preceding <em>shōdan’s</em>  <time datetime='00:43:57.000' title='00:43:57'> last line </time>: “<em>Rain dampens Genken's (Yüan Hsien) gate</em>,” in which rain is a metaphor for tears. It continues in the <em>Sageuta</em> which starts with another metaphor for tears: <time datetime='00:44:42.000' title='00:44:42'> dampened sleeves </time>. This is carried over to the next <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Ageuta</em>  with a reference to the <time datetime='00:45:40.000' title='00:45:40'>limpid moon</time> soaring over a desolate evening. The source of the nostalgia is only revealed in the following <em>shōdan</em> – the <em>Rongi</em>, when the shite asks “<em><time datetime='00:48:48.000' title='00:48:48'> When will they meet again?</time></em>,” a clear and poignant reference to a lover's yearning.</p>

  <p>The positioning of this short chant between the <em>Issei</em>-chant and the <em>Ageuta</em> is easier to appreciate when the viewer considers the shape of the vocal line across the three <em>shōdan</em>. The <em>Sageuta</em> begins in the low register, completing the descending trajectory from high to medium of the <em>Issei</em>-chant, before moving up towards the medium range, thus serving as a transition towards the high range of the coming <em>Ageuta</em>.</p>
