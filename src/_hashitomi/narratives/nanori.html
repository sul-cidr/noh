  <p>The monk introduces himself and explains his intentions in the simplest way, by speaking unaccompanied. The speech is tranquil, steady, and performed almost without movement while the actor remains on Square 1. Although the overall texture remains simple, the inclusion of the narrative that answers the 'who,' 'why,' 'what' and 'where' about the monk, gives this <em>shōdan</em> a higher Intermedia Index than the preceding <em>Nanoribue</em>.</p>

  <p>The monk concludes the <em>Nanori</em> by <time datetime='00:06:25.000' title='00:06:25'>bringing his hands together</time>, holding a Buddhist rosary in the right hand. While the origin of this gesture is believed to be related to prayer, it has become a standard closing gesture also used by secular characters such as the <a href="/kokaji/#startTime=00:04:49" target="_blank"> Emperor’s envoy </a> <a id="flipping" href="#0" onclick="window.open('/popout/hashitomi/#t=01:12:10,01:12:16&autoplay&autoclose', 'new', 'width=640,height=360');">(right arm)</a>in Kokaji.</p>
