He is followed by the <a href="/actors/#Ai" target="_blank">kyōgen</a> in a <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Ai" target="_blank">local townsman costume</a>, who sits down at the back of the bridge opposite Pine 1. The kyōgen usually enter inconspicuously in the middle of the first act during the first <em>ageuta</em>. In Hashitomi, the first <em>ageuta</em> concludes the act and is followed immediately by the shite’s exit. Thus, the kyōgen enters earlier, inconspicuously, together with the waki, so as not to interfere with the shite's exit.</div>

  <p>The play opens with the entrance of the monk accompanied by a nohkan solo. The nohkan player performs the solo in a plain fashion, which underlines the modesty of the monk, and introduces the play’s lighter tone. The monk's <a href="/staging/costumes/#Hashitomi-Waki" target="_blank"> monochromatic costume</a> gives an sense of subdued and subtle elegance.</p>

  <p>The simple instrumentation of this unmetered melody, the absence of text, and the to-be-expected simple walk-in of the actor provides this <em>shōdan</em> with the play's lowest Intermedia Index, a common way of starting the first <em>shōdan</em> of a play’s first <em>dan</em>.</p>

  <p>It is the nohkan player’s responsibility to loosely adapt the pacing of the melody to the waki’s walking speed so that the conclusion of the entrance music coincides with the waki’s final <em>kata</em> : the <time datetime='00:05:03.000' title='00:05:03'>Step back</time>.</p>
