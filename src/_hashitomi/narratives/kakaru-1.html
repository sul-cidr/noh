<br   />performs a prayer gesture.<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">

  <p>While the <em>Nanori ‘s</em> narrative has set up a story that provides a reason for the shite to appear, the <em>Kakaru</em> increases momentum before his entrance.  More prominent stage position, increased instrumentation, and changing style of vocal delivery raise the Intermedia Index. The elevated energy will be released with the shite’s appearance.</p>

  <p>The monk asserts the importance of the memorial service by moving to the center stage (Square 9). Coming from the energetically weaker Square 1, he opens up the stage space and activates one of the most powerful stage positions. Interestingly, the shite will not enter that area in the first act, limiting his actions to the quieter Squares 1 and 2.</p>

  <p>This <em>shōdan</em> also marks the first entry of the two hand-percussion instruments that accompany the non-congruent vocal part, with sparse <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Mitsuji" target="_blank"><em>mitsuji</em></a> patterns performed in flexible rhythmic setting.</p>

  <p>In the first three lines, the monk declares respect for the flowers, delivering his praises in <em>kotoba</em>. In the fourth one, he focuses specifically on the <time datetime='00:07:45.000' title='00:07:45'>lotus</time>. In Buddhism, its ability to rise from murky waters to produce a beautiful and pure flower is a symbol of enlightenment. In Noh, the recitation of a sutra is always delivered in a sung fashion, thus the monk switches at that point from spoken to singing mode. He recites the Lotus Sutra: <em>sōmoku kokudo shi’kai jōbutsudō </em> (plants, trees, all on earth, achieve Buddhahood). The <em>sashinori</em> setting of the chant with its recitative style is well suited for the delivery of a religious text.</p>

  <p>At the end of the scene, the monk performs a prayer gesture similar to the one used to close the <em>Nanori</em>. This time, it has a spiritual component as it is performed while the monk is singing the sutra. The monk joins <time datetime='00:08:32.000' title='00:08:32'>his open hands with rounded arms</time> unlike in <em>Nanori</em> when he kept <time datetime='00:06:29.000' title='nanori'>his fists closed and arms straight </time>. The separation of his hands at the end is always asymmetric. </p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that actors always stay in character. For instance, the <time datetime='00:09:01.000' title='09:01'>motion of the sleeve</time> can be technically needed only to avoid wrinkling of the costume, but it is done 'as a monk'.</p>
