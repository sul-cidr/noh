    The first <em>Ageuta</em> is the dramatic and intermedia climax not only of
    the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>, but of the whole first act. It brings a new
    and refreshing sound: the jiutai, the last performer who had not yet taken
    part in the play. The jiutai’s first entrance always delineates an important
    moment in a play, hence it's special name: <em>shodō</em>. The
    <em>Ageuta</em> is also the first <em>shōdan</em> accompanied by the full
    <em>hayashi</em> – the two percussion instruments and the nohkan. It
    produces the richest and most rhythmically consolidated texture so far with
    the chant set in <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the percussion in strict
    rhythmic setting.

    The narrative introduces an important piece of information about the main
    character's identity. In the very first line, it gives the location of her
    dwelling in Gōjo. According to the <em>Genji monogatari</em>, this location
    is associated with Lady Yūgao’s home. It is standard for an
    <em>Ageuta’s</em> first line to be repeated, a repetition that underlines
    the text. Moreover, it is also standard to separate the initial statement
    and its repetition with an
    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >
    that temporarily interrupts the narrative, creating a <em>ma</em> moment
    that emphasizes the repeated line: “<em
      ><time datetime="00:19:27.000" title="00:19:27"
        >Near Gojō, she said, of the ‘evening face.’</time
      ></em
    >”.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final passage involves stage movement related to the text. While the
    jiutai sings,
    <em
      ><time datetime="00:19:41.000" title="00:19:41"
        >“In the moment the eyes turn aside, she becomes a dream,”</time
      ></em
    >
    the shite takes Six Steps Forward, in preparation for a
    <time datetime="00:20:10.000" title="00:20:10">Right Circlet</time>,
    performed to mimic the woman’s disappearance, as announced by the jiutai:
    “<em>…as she disappears in the shadow of the flowers.</em>.” As the melodic
    line, supported by the nohkan’s
    <a href="/music/nohkan/mirokunoge" target="_blank"
      ><em>mi roku no ge</em></a
    >
    pattern, moves from the high range to medium, preparing to cadence in the
    low range, the shite performs the standard closing pair of movements
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a> and
    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>. Then,
    the shite slowly leaves the stage in complete silence.
